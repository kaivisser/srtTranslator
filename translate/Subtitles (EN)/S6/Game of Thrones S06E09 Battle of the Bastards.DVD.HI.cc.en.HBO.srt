      and Jaime told me.

37

               killed him.

         I keep hearing stories
         about you, bastard.

138
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,399
      The way people in
      the North talk about you,

139
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:40,701
  you're the greatest swordsman
  who ever walked.

140
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,738
       Maybe you are that good.

141
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:45,806
                Maybe not.

142
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,327
               I don't know
               if I'd beat you.

143
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:52,429
       But I know that
       my army will beat yours.

144
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,598
              I have 6,000 men.

145
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,953
     You have, what, half that?

146
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:01,305
                   Not even?
 Aye, you have the numbers.

147
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,575
  Will your men
  want to fight for you

148
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,911
 when they hear you
 wouldn't fight for them?

149
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:18,523
          He's good. Very good.

150
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,209
        Tell me, will you let
        your little brother die

151
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,796
           because you're too
           proud to surrender?

152
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,580
 How do we know
 you have him?

153
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:41,662
        (HORSE WHINNIES)

154
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:53,874
         RAMSAY: Now,
         if you want to save...

155
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:56,227
 You're going to die
 tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

156
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,632
     Sleep well.

157
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:13,427
            She's a fine woman,
            your sister.

158
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,863
     I look forward to
     having her back in my bed.

159
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:21,969
              And you're all
              fine-looking men.

160
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:24,338
         My dogs are
         desperate to meet you.

161
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:27,741
           I haven't fed
           them for seven days.
           They're ravenous.

162
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,278
           I wonder which parts
           they'll try first.

163
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:32,280
                     Your eyes?

164
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:34,182
                    Your balls?

165
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:38,086
                 We'll find out
                 soon enough.

166
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,207
               In the morning,
               then, bastard.

167
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,209
          JON: If he was smart,

168
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:04,561
  he'd stay inside the walls of
  Winterfell and wait us out.

169
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,796
         That's not his way.

170
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,099
       He knows
       the North is watching.

171
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,534
    If the other houses
    sense weakness on his part,

172
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,669
      they'll stop fearing him.

173
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,173
           He can't have that.
           Fear is his power.

174
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,574
        It's his weakness, too.

175
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,842
      His men don't want
      to fight for him.

176
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,076
       They're forced
       to fight for him.

177
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,478
      If they feel
      the tide turning...

178
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,763
               It's not his men
               that worry me.

179
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,265
            It's his horses.

180
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:26,867
         I know what mounted
         knights can do to us.

181
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:30,171
 You and Stannis cut through us
 like piss through snow.

182
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,306
      We're digging trenches
      all along our flanks.

183
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,408
  They won't be able to hit us
  the way that Stannis hit you,

184
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:35,710
 in a double envelopment.

185
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:41,482
          A pincer move.

186
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:49,022
      They won't be able to
      hit us from the sides.

187
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:50,858
                    Good.

188
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:57,565
 It's crucial that we
 let them charge at us.

189
00:16:57,634 --> 00:17:00,250
 They've got the numbers,
 we need the patience.

190
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:07,091
      If we let him buckle
      our center, he'll pursue.

191
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,526
     Then we'll have him
     surrounded on three sides.

192
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,631
 Did you really think
 that cunt would
 fight you man-to-man?

193
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,799
                          No.

194
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,185
                But I wanted to
                make him angry.

195
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:23,190
        I want him coming
        at us full tilt.

196
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,628
         We should all
         get some sleep.

197
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:30,698
 TORMUND: Rest, Jon Snow.
 We need you sharp tomorrow.

198
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:43,711
 SANSA: So,
 you've met the enemy,

199
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,579
 drawn up your battle plans.

200
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,618
   Aye, for what they're worth.

201
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:54,539
 You've known him
 for the space of
 a single conversation,

202
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,306
  you and your
  trusted advisors,

203
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,608
 and you sit around
 making your plans

204
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:01,011
 on how to defeat
 a man you don't know.

205
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,547
 I lived with him.

206
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,948
                I know the way
                his mind works.

207
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,518
          I know how he
          likes to hurt people.

208
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,655
         Did it ever once occur
         to you that I might
         have some insight?

209
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,359
      You're right.

210
00:18:17,046 --> 00:18:18,579
        You think he's going
        to fall into your trap.

211
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:19,680
                 He won't.

212
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:21,048
                He's the one
                who lays traps.

213
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:22,183
 JON: He's overconfident.

214
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:24,118
          He plays with people.

215
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,469
                He's far better
                at it than you.

216
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,737
               He's been doing
               it all his life.

217
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,038
 Aye, and what have I
 been doing all my life?

218
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,973
 Playing with broomsticks?

219
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,544
 I fought beyond
 the wall against worse
 than Ramsay Bolton.

220
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,280
 I've defended the wall
 from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

221
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,799
            You don't know him.

222
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,453
  All right, tell me.

223
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,022
 What should we do?
 How do we get Rickon back?

224
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,759
      We'll never get him back.

225
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,331
          Rickon is Ned Stark's
          trueborn son,

226
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,132
            which makes him
            a greater threat
            to Ramsay than you,

227
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,402
      a bastard, or me, a girl.

228
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,737
           As long as he lives,
           Ramsay's claim

229
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,339
             to Winterfell
             will be contested,

230
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:05,476
            which means
            he won't live long.

231
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,411
    We can't give up
    on our brother.

232
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,029
                 SANSA: Listen
                 to me, please.

233
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:10,581
                He wants you to
                make a mistake.

234
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,282
 JON: Of course he does.

235
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,784
 What should I do differently?

236
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:17,454
        I don't know.
        I don't know
        anything about battles.

237
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,356
       Just don't do
       what he wants you to do.

238
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,825
 Aye, that's good advice.

239
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:21,993
      You think that's obvious?

240
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,728
 Well, it is a bit obvious.

241
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,229
         If you had asked
         for my advice earlier,

242
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,898
       I would have told you
       not to attack Winterfell

243
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,066
   until we had a larger force,
   or is that obvious, too?

244
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,602
     When will we have
     a larger force?

245
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,671
 We've pleaded with every
 house that'll have us.

246
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,939
 The Blackfish can't help us.

247
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,041
     We're lucky to
     have this many men.

248
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,142
              It's not enough.

249
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,578
 No, it's not enough.
 It's what we have.

250
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:48,786
   Battles have been won
   against greater odds.

251
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,763
              If Ramsay wins,
              I'm not going
              back there alive.

252
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,065
          Do you understand me?

253
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:07,338
  I won't ever let
  him touch you again.

254
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,676
 I'll protect you, I promise.

255
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,413
         No one can protect me.

256
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,215
     No one can protect anyone.

257
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:30,778
        (SIGHS)

258
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,203
               DAVOS: You think
               there's hope?

259
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,872
 TORMUND: I've never seen
 these Bolton fuckers fight.

260
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:45,860
 And they've never
 seen the free folk fight,
 so, yes, there's hope.

261
00:20:48,231 --> 00:20:52,066
 You want to avenge
 your king, don't you?

262
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:54,601
          It wasn't the Boltons
          defeated Stannis.

263
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,036
        It was Stannis himself.

264
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:01,808
            I loved the man.
            He lifted me up and
            made me something.

265
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:04,678
        But he had demons
        in his skull
        whispering foul things.

266
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:05,812
 You saw these demons?

267
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:06,880
                     What?

268
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,967
              No, it's a manner
              of speaking.

269
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,938
             Not actual demons.

270
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,040
           Oh.

271
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,076
 Well, you loved
 that cunt Stannis

272
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,479
 and I loved
 the man he burned.

273
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,782
 Mance didn't have
 demons in his skull.

274
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,051
 He didn't torch people
 or listen to some red witch.

275
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,121
 I believed in him.

276
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,725
 I thought he was
 the man to lead us
 through the Long Night.

277
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,960
    But I was wrong,
    just like you.

278
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:42,249
 Maybe that was our mistake,
 believing in kings.

279
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,087
         Jon Snow's not a king.

280
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,723
      No, he's not.

281
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:56,863
      I need a good drink
      to help me sleep
      the night before a fight.

282
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,499
             You want some?

283
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,901
            I have a jug of
            sour goat's milk

284
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,819
            stronger than any
            of that grape water

285
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,489
             you southern twats
             like sucking on.

286
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,024
 No, thanks.
 It does sound delicious,

                 do all night?

290
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,184
 I walk. Think and walk.

291
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,621
 Think and walk
 until I'm far
 enough away from camp

292
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:22,689

 me shitting my guts out.

            I'll have to try.

00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,508
          I'm ordering you
          not to bring me back.

        I do what he commands.

309

       How do you know
       what he commands?

310
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,872
          I interpret his signs

311

             as well as I can.

312
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,682

     want me to bring you back,
     how did I bring you back?

313

     plan and nothing else.

318

 Last time we saw each other
 was at Winterfell, yes?

324
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,822
  You were making
  jokes about my height,
  I seem to recall.

325
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,226
 Everyone who makes a joke
 about a dwarf's height

326
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:23,530
 thinks he's the only person
 ever to make a joke
 about a dwarf's height.

 "a man of your stature,"

 "someone to look up to."

329
00:26:29,972 --> 00:26:31,821
 You're all making
 the same five or six jokes.

330
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,073
        It was a long time ago.

331
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:35,242
         It was.

332
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,095
 And how have things
 been going for you since then?

333
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,898
 Not so well, I gather.

334
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,884
   Can't imagine you
   would have murdered
   the Stark boys

335
00:26:43,952 --> 00:26:45,218
 if things had
 been going well.

336
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:47,453
         I didn't murder
         the Stark boys.

337
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,123
        But I did things
        that were just
        as bad or worse.

338
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,291
          And he paid for them.

339
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,693
 Doesn't seem like it.

340
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:55,446
 He's still alive.

341
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:58,882
 It was complicated
 for you, I'm sure,
 growing up at Winterfell.

342
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,936
 Never quite
 knowing who you were.

343
00:27:03,005 --> 00:27:06,657
 But then, we all live
 complicated lives, don't we?

344
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:10,277

    from the Iron Fleet
    with men to sail them.

345

       you want me to
       support your claim

346
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,198
     to the throne
     of the Iron Islands?

347
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,101
           Not my claim. Hers.

348
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:19,252
 And what's wrong with you?

349
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:20,854
           I'm not fit to rule.

350
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:22,656
 We can agree
 upon that at least.

351
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,241
       Has the Iron Islands
       ever had a queen before?

352
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,793
         No more than Westeros.

353
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,349
          Our Uncle Euron
          returned home
          after a long absence.

354
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:35,536
         He murdered our father
         and took the
         Salt Throne from Yara.

355
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:38,605
    He would have
    murdered us if we'd stayed.

356
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:42,743
 Lord Tyrion tells me
 your father was
 a terrible king.

357
00:27:42,812 --> 00:27:44,878
                You and I have
                that in common.

358
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:50,167
   We do.
   And both murdered
   by a usurper as well.

359
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,320
 Will their ships be enough?

360
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:56,422
 With the former
 Masters' fleet, possibly.

361
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:57,541
     Barely.

362
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,378
 There are more than
 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.

363

    and Euron is building more.

364
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:05,532
             He's going to
             offer them to you.

365
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,000
    So why shouldn't
    I wait for him?

366
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:10,203
       The Iron Fleet
       isn't all he's bringing.

367
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,822
                 He also wants
                 to give you...

368
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,841
             His big cock,
             I think he said.

369
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:18,811
 Euron's offer is also
 an offer of marriage, you see.

370
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,914
             You won't get one
             without the other.

371
00:28:20,983 --> 00:28:24,100
          And I imagine
          your offer is free of
          any marriage demands?

372
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,704
       I never demand,
       but I'm up for anything,
       really.

373
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,675
  THEON: He murdered our father
  and would have murdered us.

374
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:33,994
            He'll murder you
            as soon as you
            have what he wants.

375
00:28:34,063 --> 00:28:35,695
  The Seven Kingdoms.

376

         All of them.

377
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:38,948
 And you don't want
 the Seven Kingdoms?

378
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,785
         THEON: Your ancestors
         defeated ours and took
         the Iron Islands.

379
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,022
             We ask you
             to give them back.

380
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:46,523
   And that's all?

381

       murder an uncle or two

         a woman's fit to rule.

383
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,212
       Reasonable.

384
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,350
   What if everyone
   starts demanding
   their independence?

385
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,069
    She's not demanding,
    she's asking.

386
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,472
    The others are
    free to ask as well.

387
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:09,879
    Our fathers were evil men,
    all of us here.

388
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,565
   They left the world
   worse than they found it.

389
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:14,084
  We're not going to do that.

390

 We're going to leave the world
 better than we found it.

391
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:22,609
 You will support my claim
 as queen of the Seven Kingdoms

392
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,330
 and respect the integrity
 of the Seven Kingdoms.

 No more reaving, roving,
 raiding, or raping.

        That's our way of life.
