      to the Red Keep.

137
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,021
   Have been permitted?

138
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,174
 That's rather a tortured way
 of putting it.

139

        They demand to see you,
        Your Grace.

140
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,795
    Who permitted them
    inside the Red Keep?

141
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,718

     of their presence?

             He is, Your Grace.

143
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,789
          He's currently in his
          chambers at prayer.

   Your Grace,

   wishes to speak with you
   at the Great Sept of Baelor.

   is welcome to see me here
   in the Red Keep.

147
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,600
          Your Grace, this is
          not a request.

148
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,119
       It is a request,
       Cousin Lancel.

149
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:20,471
       You are asking me
       for something,
       I'm refusing.

00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,860
            The High Septon
            commands you.

151
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:27,645
        Are you sure
        you want to refuse him?

152
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:33,150
  He promised me I could
  stay in the Red Keep
  until my trial.

153
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,419
      He made no such promises.

154
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,323
     If you refuse to come
     of your own free will...
        Get out.

         Now listen to me, Pod.

207
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:16,757
        See how your feet
        are about a yard apart?

208
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:19,093
             Lesson number one,
             assume everyone
             wants to hit you.

 you'd find her.

 Sansa was dead.

214
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:31,606
     Why would you assume that?

215
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:35,492
   In my experience,
   girls like her
   don't live very long.

216
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,662
         I don't think you know
         many girls like her.

217
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,482
 Well, I'm proud of you.

218
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:45,753
 I am. You fulfilled
 your oath to Catelyn Stark
 against all odds.

219
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:47,871
  Of course, my sister
  wants Sansa dead.

220
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:51,575
    The girl is still a suspect
    in Joffrey's murder,

221
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:55,162

 for the Blackfish.

    You're welcome to have him.

 Lady Sansa desires to
 take her ancestral seat
 back from the Boltons

226
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,377
 and assume her
 rightful position as
 Lady of Winterfell.

227
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,346
   With what army does she plan
   on taking Winterfell?

228

   The Tully army.

229
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,766
         They're a bit occupied
         at the moment.

230
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:19,203
    I was sent here to reclaim
    Riverrun currently defended
    by the Tully rebels,

231
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,171
             so you can
             see the conundrum.

232
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,423
 The Tullys are rebels
 because they're fighting
 for their home?

233
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,643
           Riverrun was granted
           to the Freys by
           royal decree.

234
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,363
 As a reward for betraying
 Robb Stark and slaughtering
 his family.

235
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:30,864
                 Exactly.

236
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:36,620
           We shouldn't argue
           about politics.

237
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,288
 You're a knight,
 Ser Jaime.

240
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:46,380
          Don't ask me to
          betray my own house.

241
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:48,849

245

 Allow me to enter Riverrun
 under a flag of truce.

246
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,030
 Let me try to persuade
 the Blackfish to give up
 the castle.

247
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,249
          Why would he abandon
          his ancestral home?

248
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:08,652
 Because you'll allow him
 to lead the Tully forces
 safely north.

251

           No.
        He's even more stubborn
        than you are.

252
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,114
                  All right.

253
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,367
       Try to talk some
       sense into the old goat.

254
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,836

         but his men might.

255

 for someone else's home.

256

257

           abandon the castle,

258

              for a purpose.

263

267
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,413
            Yes, Lady Brienne?

268
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:29,349
 Should I fail to persuade
 the Blackfish to surrender

    the castle,

00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,289

 for Sansa's kin.

271
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:37,024
             Of course it does.

272
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,892
       To fight you.

273
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:46,200
          Let's hope it doesn't
          come to that.

274
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:58,044
 BLACKFISH: I've said no
 three times already.

275
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,314
 I have a signed letter
 from your niece Sansa Stark...

276
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,249
 I haven't seen her
 since she was a child.

277
00:20:02,318 --> 00:20:04,518
 I don't know her signature.
 I don't know you.

278
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:07,905
 And I will not surrender.
 Double the guards tonight.

279
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:11,592
 The Kingslayer
 wants to try us.

280
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:13,210
       I can feel it.

281
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:16,330
              As I have said,
              my name is...

282
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:19,467
         Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
         I know your father.
         Good man.

283
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:21,519
 He always spoke
 highly of you.

284
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,654
       And if he were here now,
       I'd tell him the same
       I'm telling you.

285
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,424
    If you think I'm abandoning
    my family's seat on the
    Kingslayer's word of honor,

286
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,976
          you're a bloody fool.

287
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:31,478
         Riverrun cannot stand
         against the Lannisters
         and the Freys.

288
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:35,065
       We can stand longer than
       your one-handed friend
       thinks we can.

289
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:39,119
  He's not my friend.
                       No?

290
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:42,356
       Who gave you permission
       to cross the siege line
       and enter the castle?

291
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:45,258
        Who gave you that sword
        with the gold lion
        on the pommel?

292
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,329
 Ser Jaime kept his word
 to your niece Catelyn Stark.

293
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:52,433
 He sent me to find Sansa,
 to help her as Catelyn wanted.

294
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,635
 He gave me this sword
 to protect her.

295
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:56,136
 That is what I have done

296
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:59,523
 and I will continue to do
 until the day I die.

297
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,569
                 (CHUCKLES)

298
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,138
               She's exactly
               like her mother.

299
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,614
   I don't have enough men
   to help her take Winterfell.

300
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,834
     You have more
     than she does.

301
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:29,587
      She wants her home back.
      I understand that.

302
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,421
           But this is my home.

303
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,457
         And if Jaime Lannister
         wants it,

304
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,410
    he can bloody well take it
    the way everyone else does.

305
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,379
  Find the maester.

306
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,749
 We need to get a raven
 north to Sansa.

307
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,053
           What should I write?

308
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,924
  Tell her I failed.

        a royal announcement?

312
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,042
          There is.

313
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,677
        Why wasn't I informed?

314
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,748
    There is to be
    a royal announcement

     in the throne room

00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:52,887
    at this very moment.

 Where are you going?

318
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,029
          To stand by my son.

319

   are the two pillars
   that hold up this world.

   you will be punished.

  After conferring with
  His Holiness the High Septon,

329
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:08,562
      we have determined
      that Loras Tyrell and
      Cersei Lannister's trial

330
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,831
      will be held in
      the Great Sept of Baelor

   Furthermore, after much
   prayer and reflection,

334
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:28,098
  the Crown has decided
  that from this day forward,

335
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:31,335
   trial by combat will be
   forbidden throughout
   the Seven Kingdoms.

336
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:36,489
      The tradition
      is a brutish one,

337
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,491
      a scheme devised
      by corrupt rulers

338

   in order to avoid true
   judgment from the gods.

339
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:45,799
  Cersei Lannister and
  Loras Tyrell will stand trial
  before seven septons

 Why don't either
 of you ever drink?

         Unsullied never drink.

359

                Rules.

360

  And who made these rules?

361

            What's your excuse?

365
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,168
      I have tried wine before.

 One day, after our queen
 has taken the Seven Kingdoms,

376
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,630
             I'd like to have
             my own vineyard.

377
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,234
            Make my own wine.

378

           The Imp's Delight.

379
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,140
          Only my close friends
          could drink it.

380
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,245
          Tell me a joke,
          Missandei of Naath.

381
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:31,231
       I do not know any jokes.

382
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:33,066
     Grey Worm?

383
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:36,886
          Right.

384
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,426
  Three lords
  walk into a tavern.

385
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,762
 A Stark, a Martell
 and a Lannister.

386
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,613
 They order ale,

387
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:49,349
 but when the barkeep
 brings them over,

388
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,918
   each of them finds
   a fly in his cup.

389
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:56,406
 The Lannister, outraged,
 shoves the cup aside
 and demands another.

390
00:27:56,475 --> 00:28:00,344
 The Martell plucks the fly out
 and swallows it whole.

391
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:04,414
 The Stark reaches
 into his cup,

392
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,385
  pulls out the fly
  and shouts,

393
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,105
 "Spit it out, you wee shit.
 Spit it out."

394
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,513
 It's funnier in Westeros.

395
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:23,599
 The Starks and the Lannisters,
 I thought these were enemies.

396
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,835
         Yes.

397
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,671
        A joke is like a story,
        Torgo Nudho.

398
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:30,674
            Not a true story,
            necessarily.

399
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:33,961
 A story that's supposed
 to make you laugh ideally.

400
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:35,929
 Not at the moment, perhaps.

401
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:38,215
 Missandei, do you
 like the wine?

402
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,766
                  I do.

403
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:41,134
     Tell a joke.

404
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:50,059
         Two translators
         are on a sinking ship.

405
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,831
               The first says,

406
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,499
     "Do you know how to swim?"

407
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:00,637
       The second says, "No,
       but I can shout for help
       in 19 languages."

408
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,626

 She should have killed you.

476
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:04,831
       Perhaps, but she didn't.

477

       Catelyn Stark hated me
       just like you hate me.

478
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,388
         But I didn't hate her.

479
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,257
            I admired her.

480
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,226
      Far more than her husband
      or her son.

    whom you admire
    and whom you don't?

482
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,931
    No, I don't, but I'm
    telling you anyway
    because you're my prisoner.

483
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,533
       You don't have a choice.

484
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,869
     The love she had
     for her children,

    (GRUNTING)

492
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,958
        She loved her children.

493
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,145
      I suppose all mothers do,

494
00:33:52,214 --> 00:33:54,114
        but Catelyn and Cersei,

495
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:56,716
         there's a fierceness
         you don't often see.

496
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,452
         They'd do anything to
         protect their babies.

      Free their worst enemies.

499
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:07,460
     The things we do for love.

500
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:15,568
 You didn't come here
 to talk about our sisters.
 (PANTING)

    You can laugh at that
    if you want. You can sneer.
    Doesn't matter.

504
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:28,782
              She needs me.

505
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,885
       And to get back to her,
       I have to take Riverrun.

506

509
00:34:42,931 --> 00:34:45,665
       Because you don't matter
       to me, Lord Edmure.

00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:48,568
               Your son doesn't
               matter to me.

511
00:34:48,637 --> 00:34:52,239
       The people in the castle
       don't matter to me.

512
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:57,010
            Only Cersei.

513
00:34:57,078 --> 00:35:01,748
     And if I have to slaughter
     every Tully who ever lived
     to get back to her,

514
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,152
           that's what I'll do.

   his king at the Red Wedding.

    Why do you think the people
    who murdered his king
    at the Red Wedding

526
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,125
        would decide to let him
        come home?
