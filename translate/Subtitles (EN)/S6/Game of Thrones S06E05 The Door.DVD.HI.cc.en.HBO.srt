     about Ramsay?

 about our wedding night?

         He never hurt my face.

19

           with the rest of me

22

          What else?

 Did he cut you?

31
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,272
    Maybe you did know
    about Ramsay all along.

  I underestimated
  a stranger.

      talk about those things,

  talk about them all the time.

39

           I can still feel it.

40
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,647
          I don't mean in
          my tender heart
          it still pains me so.

41
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:46,050
       I can still feel
       what he did in my body
       standing here right now.

42
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:50,955
  I'm so sorry.

     you would protect me.

   You can't protect me.

 to protect yourself if I tell
 Brienne to cut you down.

 Do you want me
 to beg for my life?

51

 If that's what
 you want, I will.

 that is in my power,

           to die here and now?

00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,312
 Then I will die.

55
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,302
            You freed me from
            the monsters who
            murdered my family,

56
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:40,822

        to other monsters

266
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,407
 Little Theon.

267
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,178
         Heard you managed
         to fuck things
         right into the ground.

268
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,480
      (SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

269
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,882
    EURON: Captured a castle
    you couldn't keep.

270
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,984
     Got yourself
     taken prisoner.

271
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,987
    Even heard
    you have no cock.

272
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:03,310
    Explains why
    you think a woman
    can be king.

273
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:06,163
                When did you
                return, Uncle?
 EURON: A few days ago.

274
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,051
  I had some things
  to take care of.

275
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,735
      Long overdue.

276
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:14,788
     I'm glad you're here.

277
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:20,561
       Now I know what my first
       act as queen will be.

278
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:23,363
          To execute the man
          who killed my father.

279
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:24,448
      (SCATTERED CHATTER)

280
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,188
                     I did.

281
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:33,507
     I killed him.

282
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:38,495
 Threw him right
 over a rope bridge,
 and watched him fall.

283
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,933
 He was leading
 us nowhere,

284
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,485
 and we would still
 be heading there
 if it weren't for me.

285
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,606
 No one loved him.
 No one wanted
 to follow him.

286
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,625
 He led us into two
 wars we couldn't win.

287
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:55,595
 I apologize to you
 all for not killing
 him years ago.

288
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,765
          THEON: That would
          have been hard to do.

289
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,884
              You weren't here.

290
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:03,437
  Last I heard, you were
  gallivanting around the world
  having a grand old time.

291
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:05,338
      "Gallivanting"?

292
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,940
 That the sort of thing
 you start to say

293
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:09,393
     once your dick
     gets chopped off?

294
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:12,463
 Did the great lords
 of Westeros teach
 you words like that?

295
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,298
                 You were gone.

296
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:16,967
                 Yara was here.

297
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,719
              Being ironborn.
              Leading ironborn.

298
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:23,157
         Getting ready to bring
         us back to glory.

299
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:25,476
              EURON: And how
              will she do that?

300
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:29,046
           I will build the
           largest fleet the
           world has ever seen.

301
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,933
         Right idea,

302
00:22:33,002 --> 00:22:35,469
   except I'm the one
   who's going to build
   the Iron Fleet

303
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:37,872
 because I'm the one
 who knows how to use it.

304
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,523
 I've been all over
 the world.

305
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:43,027
   I've seen more of it
   than all of you combined.

306
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:45,863
      And across the sea
      there is a person

307
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:50,334
         who hates the great
         lords of Westeros
         just as much as we do.

308
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:52,236
 Someone with
 a large army,

309
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,588
         three large dragons,

310
00:22:54,657 --> 00:22:55,656
            and no husband.

311
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,725
             I'm going to build
             that fleet

312
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,094
    and I'm going
    to gallivant right over

313
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:04,715
   and give it to
   Daenerys Targaryen
   along with my big cock.

314
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:05,850
      (SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

315
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,818
         You're going to seduce
         the Dragon Queen?

316
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,154
 I'm not going to
 seduce her. The Iron
 Fleet will seduce her.

317
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:14,024
 And together
 we're going to take
 the Seven Kingdoms.

318
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:17,611
 I wasn't born to be king.

319
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,548
 I paid the iron price,
 and here I stand.

320
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,333

         Euron! Euron!

323
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,860
        Euron! Euron!

324
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,193
 May Euron, your servant,
 be born again from
 the sea as you were.

325
00:23:50,246 --> 00:23:53,497
 Bless him with salt.
 Bless him with stone.

326
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,332
 Bless him with steel.

327
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,568
 Listen to the waves.
 Listen to the god.

328
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,355
 He is speaking to us
 and he says,

329
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:06,493
 "We shall have no king
 but Euron Greyjoy."

330
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:09,947
 Let the sea wash your follies
 and your vanities away.

331
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,849
 Let the old Euron drown.

332
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:14,568
 Let his lungs
 fill with seawater.

333
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:23,878
 Let the fish eat
 the scales off his eyes.

334
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:26,379
 What is dead may never die.

335
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:29,967
     But rises again
     harder and stronger.

              our best ships.

346
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,905
  Won't be enough
  to save them.

347
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,159
           Go back
           to your homes.

348
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,528
   Chop down every
   tree you can find.

349
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,231
   Quarter-saw the timber
   and start building.

350
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,333
       I want every man
       bending planks.

351
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:46,937
   I want every woman
   spinning flax for sails.

352
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,489
     Build me 1,000 ships.

353
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:52,225
        And I will give
        you this world.

354
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,647
  I banished you, twice.

355
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,534
 You came back, twice.

356
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,139
 And you saved my life.

357
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,064
 So I can't take you back,

358
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:31,965
 and I can't send you away.

359
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
                  You must
                  send me away.

360
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,285
    Is there a cure?

361
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:53,703
              I don't know.

362
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,707
 How long does it take?

363
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,609
      I don't know that either.

364
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,046
     But I've seen what happens
     when it goes far enough.

365
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,848
   I'll end things before that.

366
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,554
       I'm sorry.

367
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,106
 (CRYING) I'm so sorry.

368
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:15,308
                Don't be.

369
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:17,661
           All I've ever wanted
           was to serve you.

370
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:23,817
               Tyrion Lannister
               was right.

371
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:28,572
              I love you.

372
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,311
          I'll always love you.

00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,586
           Goodbye, Khaleesi.

374
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,827
     Do not walk away
     from your queen,
     Jorah the Andal.

375
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,400
  You have not
  been dismissed.

376
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,520
 You pledged yourself to me.

377
00:29:00,588 --> 00:29:03,256
 You swore to obey my commands
 for the rest of your life.

378
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,911
 Well, I command
 you to find the cure,

379
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,015
 wherever it is
 in this world.

380
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:16,653
    I command you
    to heal yourself,

381
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,539
 and then return to me.

382
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,878
      When I take
      the Seven Kingdoms,

383
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:27,998
  I need you by my side.

384
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,857
          In the last fortnight
          since our pact
          with the Masters,

385
00:30:10,926 --> 00:30:14,361
      how many killings
      have been carried out
      by the Sons of the Harpy?

386
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:16,096
                     None.

387
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:18,731
      And how many Masters
      have been butchered
      by the free men?

388
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,251
           Two, but that was
           the day of the pact.

389
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,986
           Since then, nothing.

390
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:26,339
      So, it's safe to say
      that a fragile peace
      has taken hold.

391
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,541
                  For now.

392
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:29,643
    "For now" is the best
    we get in our profession.

393
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:31,311
 It's not enough.

394
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:32,946
      Considering the
      city was on the
      brink of civil war,

395
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:34,981
        I'd say it's
        a good start.

396
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,651
 It's not enough for
 Meereen to have peace.

397
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:40,470
 They need to know
 Daenerys is
 responsible for it.

398
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,889
 The Sons of the Harpy
 have a good story.

399
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:45,158
 Resist the foreign invaders.

400
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:47,427
   Our queen has
   an even better story.

401
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:52,582
   Mother of Dragons,
   Breaker of Chains,
   all that.

          The people know who
          brought them freedom.

403
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,321
 Yes, but do they know
 who brought them security?

404
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,622
 Who brought about
 an end to the violence?

405
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,226
 We need someone
 the people trust,

406
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:05,863
     someone they know
     cannot be bought
     or influenced.

407
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,698
   Sounds like quite the hero.
   Where would we find him?

408
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,100
     Who said anything
     about "him"?

 all this way.

 the journey can be.

 The truth is
 we need your help.

 We had hoped that
 we could somehow
 persuade you to...

416
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,489
                You don't need
                to persuade me.

             Daenerys Stormborn
             is the one who
             was promised.

  She has freed the slaves from
  their chains and crucified
  the masters for their sins.

 purifying too
 many nonbelievers.

   You want your queen
   to be worshipped and obeyed.

432
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:59,625
      And while she's gone, you
      want her advisors to be
      worshipped and obeyed.

433
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:03,129

          A man named

441
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:27,470
          He, too, had
          a glorious destiny.

442
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,122
 He attacked
 King's Landing

443
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:32,758
 and was soundly
 defeated by the man
 standing beside me.

444
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:35,328
 Last I had heard,
 he had been
 defeated again,

445

       this time at Winterfell,
       and this time for good.

            admit a mistake.

 Isn't that the whole

              are for a reason.

         happen for a reason.

462

         to you, Lord Varys,
         when you were a child.

      a second-rate sorcerer,

464

 Northerners are different.

            three other houses
            in the North,

525
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:24,647
       Glover, Mormont,
       Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood.

526
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:25,865
 Two dozen more.

527
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:28,367
 Together they
 equal all the others.

528
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:30,836
  We can start
  small and build.

529
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,105
 SANSA: The North remembers.

530
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,373
 They remember
 the Stark name.

531
00:41:34,442 --> 00:41:36,392
    People will still
    risk everything for it,

532
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,927
     from White Harbor
     to Ramsay's own door.

533
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,380
              I don't doubt it.

534
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:43,082
           But Jon doesn't have
           the Stark name.

535
00:41:43,151 --> 00:41:44,483
  No, but I do.

536
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,842
 Jon is every bit as much
 Ned Stark's son as Ramsay
 is Roose Bolton's.

537
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:54,911
 And there are also the Tullys.
 They're not Northern,

538
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,813
 but they will back us
 against the Boltons
 without question.

539
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,698
               I didn't know
               the Tullys still
               had an army.

540
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,601
         My uncle the Blackfish
         has reformed it
         and retaken Riverrun.

541
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:06,222
 How do you know that?

542
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,191
          Ramsay received
          a raven before
          I escaped Winterfell.

543
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,513
                  That's good.

544
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:16,966
     The Blackfish is a legend.
     His support would
     mean a great deal.

545
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:21,287
             Stark, Tully,
             a few more houses,

546
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:23,206

 you, my lady.

548
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:31,463
      You heard them.
      We need more men,
      and my uncle has an army.

549
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:33,482
 We can send
 the Blackfish a raven.

550
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:37,020
    Can't risk Ramsay
    intercepting it.
    It has to be you.

551
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,621

552
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,490
         My uncle will talk
         to you and you'll know
         how to talk to him.

557
00:42:50,435 --> 00:42:53,252
 BRIENNE: Not him.
 He seems trustworthy.

558
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,538
    A bit brooding,
    perhaps.

559
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:57,440
  I suppose that's
  understandable,

  with blood magic.

563

 paid for his crime,
 where were they?

00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:22,648
          Jon isn't Davos, the

          for that matter.

568

            I trust him.

570
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:32,725
      Then why did
      you lie to him

571
00:43:32,794 --> 00:43:34,494
