128
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,135
      You marched
      against the High Sparrow,
      against the Faith.

129
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,154
 We marched for you.

130
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,306
       The gods could have
       punished you and Father,
       but they didn't.

131
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,108
             They showed mercy.
 And what about your brother?

132

         his crimes and repent.

00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,483
       If he does,
       the Faith will allow him
       to return to Highgarden.

135

         his name and title...

137
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,455
            ...and live his
            life as a penitent.

            He can begin again.

140
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:48,145
 As a mindless fanatic.

141
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:49,948
                 As a free man.

142
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:53,784
 You will leave for
 Highgarden today.

143
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,421
 There is no law that
 says you must stay here.

144
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,791
                I am the Queen.

145
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,961
         It is my duty to serve
         my husband, the King.

146
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:08,649
          But you should leave,
          Grandmother.

147
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:11,686
         Your place is at home.

148
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,122
 I will never leave you.
 Never.

149
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,189
               You must.

150
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,694
               Go home.

151
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,898
         Find comfort in
         prayer and good works.

152

           watches over us all.

153
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,262
 I'll see you soon,
 my dear.

154
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,237
      Seven blessings to you,
      Grandmother.

155
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,617
      Shall we pray?

156

157
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:19,137
      We said we'd fight
      with you, King Crow,

158
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,139
      when the time comes,
      and we meant it,

159
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,157
   but this isn't
   what we agreed to.

160
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:24,558
 These aren't White Walkers.

161
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,710
 This isn't
 an army of the dead.

162
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,097
 This isn't our fight.

163
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,885
   TORMUND:
   If it weren't for him,
   none of us would be here.

164
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,437
 All of you would be meat
 in the Night King's army.

165
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,573
              And I'd be a pile
              of charred bones,
              just like Mance.

166
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,109
   Remember Mance's camp?

167
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,746
    It stretched all
    the way to the horizon.

168
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:46,848
 And look at us now.

169
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,482
 Look what's left of us.

170
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:52,720
 And if we lose this,
 we're gone.

171
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:56,941
    Dozens of tribes,
    hundreds of generations.

172
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,893
      Be like we were
      never there at all.

173
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,811
       We'll be the last
       of the free folk.

174
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,400
      That's what'll
      happen to you if we lose.

175
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,987
     The Boltons,
     the Karstarks, the Umbers,

176
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,323
        they know you're here.

177
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,293
        They know that
        more than half of you
        are women and children.

178
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,511
   After they finish with me,
   they'll come for you.

179
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:20,347
         You're right.

180
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,900
     This isn't your fight.

181
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,702
     You shouldn't have to come
     to Winterfell with me.

182
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,504
   I shouldn't be asking you.

183
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,089
     It's not the deal we made.

184
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,227
   I need you with me
   if we're going to beat them,

185
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:35,296
    and we need to beat them
    if you're going to survive.

186
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,988
           The crows killed him
           because he spoke
           for the free folk

187
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,540
 when no other
 Southerners would.

188
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:49,593
        He died for us.

189
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:53,531
    If we are not willing
    to do the same for him,
    we're cowards.

190
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,884
   And if that's what we are,

191
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,470
     we deserve to be
     the last of the free folk.

194
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,583
   Are you sure they'll come?

195
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,687
 We're not clever
 like you Southerners.

196
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:09,790
 When we say we'll do
 something, we do it.

197
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:29,409
    I heard you were
    leaving King's Landing.

198
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,848
   That is hardly your concern.

199
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:35,749
       Your grandson is
       still a prisoner.

200
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:37,585
       You'll leave him
       rotting in a cell?

201
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:40,988
         Loras rots in
         a cell because of you.

202
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:44,525
               The High Sparrow
               rules this city
               because of you.

203
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:47,361
           Our two ancient
           houses face collapse

204
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,815
            because of you
            and your stupidity.

205
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:53,151
      You're right.

206
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,472
 I made a terrible mistake.
 I carry it with me
 every single day.

207
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,841
                  Good.

208
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,045
      I delivered
      an army of fanatics
      onto our doorstep.

209
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:06,147
      And now we must
      fight them together.

210
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,067
   We need each other.

211
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:16,273
        I wonder if
        you're the worst person
        I've ever met.

212
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,176
           At a certain age,
           it's hard to recall.

213
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:24,248
             But the truly
             vile do stand out
             through the years.

214
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,850

      the way you smirked at me

215
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,384
              when my grandson
              and granddaughter

216
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,787
               were dragged off
               to their cells?

217
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,923
    I do. I'll never forget it.

218
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,258
 You love your granddaughter.

219
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,146
 I love my son.

220
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:39,914
 It's the only truth I know.

221
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:43,584
 We must defend them.

222
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:46,587
      I'm leaving this wretched
      city as fast as I can,

223
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:50,908
    before that shoeless zealot
    throws me into
    one of his cells.

   bright as you think you are,

225
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,378
              you'll find a way
              out of here, too.

226

          What'll you do, then?

229
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,836
           You have no support.
           Not anymore.

  thousands of them.

          them all by yourself?

                 Lothar, is it?

274
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,229
 Ser Jaime.

275
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:07,581
 We didn't know
 you were coming.

276
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,433
        'Cause you didn't
        set a proper perimeter.

277
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:12,753
     You just allowed 8,000 men
     to approach unchallenged.

278
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:16,273
    Good thing we're friends
    or we'd be fucking you
    in the ass right now.

279
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,042
               Have Lord Edmure
               bathed and fed.

280
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,109
          Whoa, whoa!

281
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,695
 Walder.

282
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:26,834
   Edmure is
   a prisoner of House Frey.

283
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,656
         Only a fool
         makes threats he's not
         prepared to carry out.

284
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:35,609
          Now, let's say I
          threatened to hit you

285
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:38,445
    unless you shut your mouth,
    but you kept talking.

286
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,380
      What do you think I'd do?
 I don't give a rat's...

287
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:41,482
 (GRUNTS)

288
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:45,502
 I'm here by the King's command
 to take back this castle.

289
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,488
    Have him bathed and fed.

290
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,558
             Unless you'd like
             to take his place.

291
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:53,761
 Apologies, Ser Jaime.

292
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:55,562
 Do as he says.

293
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:58,098
              The siege is now
              under my command.

294
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,568
        The next time
        the Blackfish looks out
        from those ramparts,

295
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:03,753
          he'll see
          an army at his gates,
          not whatever this is.

296
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,872
  Have your lads start
  digging perimeter trenches.

297
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:07,591
 Set pickets
 every hundred yards.

298
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,127
 And work double-time
 on those siege towers
 and trebuchets.

299
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,528
 Those are our siege towers...

300
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:14,799
           As I said, the siege
           is under my command.

301
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,667
     If that's not to
     your liking, go home.

302
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,008
 Get word to the Blackfish.

303
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,410
 I want a parley.

304
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,812
           A parley or a fight?

305
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,315
 He's an old man.

306
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,284
           You've got one hand.

307
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,319
     My money's on the old boy.

310
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,174
         Lady Mormont.

311
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:00,294
      Welcome to Bear Island.

312
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,954
 I remember when you
 were born, my lady.

313
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,672
      You were named
      for my Aunt Lyanna.

314
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,308
 It was said she
 was a great beauty.
 I'm sure you will be, too.

315
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:16,310
          I doubt it.

316
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,262
   My mother
   wasn't a great beauty
   or any other kind of beauty.

317
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,564
    She was a great warrior,
    though.

318
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:22,583
         She died fighting
         for your brother Robb.

319
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,806
  I served under your uncle
  at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.

320
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,910
 He was also a great warrior
 and an honorable man.

321
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,661
 I was his steward. In fact...

322
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,631
             I think we've had
             enough small talk.
             Why are you here?

323
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,170
 Stannis Baratheon
 garrisoned at Castle Black

324
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:45,889
 before he
 marched on Winterfell
 and was killed.

325
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,609
  He showed me
  the letter you wrote to him
  when he petitioned for men.

326
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,544
           It said...
       I remember what it said.

327
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:52,212
     "Bear Island knows no king

328
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,848
     "but the King in the North
     whose name is Stark."

329
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:01,438
        Robb is gone,
        but House Stark is not.

330
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,491
      And it needs your support
      now more than ever.

331
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,310
        I've come with
        my sister to ask

332
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,028
        for House
        Mormont's allegiance.

333
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:13,234
                 (INAUDIBLE)

334
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:24,011
    As far as I understand,
    you're a Snow,
    and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.

335
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,913
         Or is she a Lannister?

336
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:28,198
           I've heard
           conflicting reports.

337
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,434
        I did what I had to
        do to survive, my lady.

338
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,004
 But I am a Stark.
 I will always be a Stark.

339
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,622
             If you say so.

340
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,342
        In any case,
        you don't just
        want my allegiance.

341
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:39,943
      You want my fighting men.

342
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,779
 Ramsay Bolton
 cannot be allowed
 to keep Winterfell, my lady.

343
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,914
 It is our duty to stop him.

344
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,218
   Even more so because
   he holds our brother,
   Rickon Stark, as prisoner.

345
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:53,206
 What you have to understand,
 my lady, is that...

346
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:55,275
           I understand
           that I'm responsible

347
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:57,444
            for Bear Island and
            all who live here.

348
00:24:57,513 --> 00:25:01,515
   So why should I
   sacrifice one more Mormont
   life for someone else's war?

349
00:25:07,623 --> 00:25:09,189
          If it please my lady,

350
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:12,743
     I understand how you feel.

351
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:15,028
       I don't know you, Ser...

352
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,497
    Davos,
    my lady, of House Seaworth.

353
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:19,699
 You needn't ask your maester
 about my house.

354
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,218
               It's rather new.

355
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,490
   All right,
   Ser Davos of House Seaworth.

356
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,777
       How is it you
       understand how I feel?

357
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:33,346
 You never thought
 you'd find yourself
 in your position.

358
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:36,784
 Being responsible
 for so many lives
 at such a young age.

359
00:25:36,852 --> 00:25:38,619
 I never thought I'd
 be in my position.

360
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:41,805
     I was a crabber's son,
     then I was a smuggler.

361
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:45,209
   And now I find
   myself addressing the lady

362
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,477
        of a great house
        in time of war.

363
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,682
 But I'm here because
 this isn't someone else's war.

364
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,418
      It's our war.

365
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,888
            Go on, Ser Davos.

366
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,508
      Your uncle,
      Lord Commander Mormont,

367
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,662
     made that man his steward.

368
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,379
               He chose Jon to
               be his successor

369
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:08,615
          because he knew
          he had the courage
          to do what was right,

370
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,003
               even if it meant
               giving his life.

371
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,423
   Because Jeor Mormont
   and Jon Snow both understood

372
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,627
    that the real
    war isn't between
    a few squabbling houses.

373
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,296
    It's between
    the living and the dead.

374
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,567
 And make no mistake, my lady,

375
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:29,003
   the dead are coming.

376
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:32,806
           Is this true?

377
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,711
 Your uncle fought them
 at the Fist of the First Men.

378
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,363
 I fought them at Hardhome.

379
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:43,150
    We both lost.

380
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:46,837
   As long as
   the Boltons hold Winterfell,
   the North is divided.

381
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:50,457
 And a divided North
 won't stand a chance
 against the Night King.

382
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,228
 You want to protect
 your people, my lady.
 I understand.

383
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:57,647
              But there's no
              hiding from this.

384
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,499
 We have to fight,

385
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,835
 and we need to do it together.

386
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,865
   House Mormont has kept faith
   with House Stark
   for 1,000 years.

387
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,237
 We will not break faith today.

388
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:29,379
      Thank you, my lady.

389
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,331
       How many fighting
       men can we expect?

390
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,439
              Sixty-two.

391
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:44,444
           Sixty-two?

392
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:47,230
      We are not a large house,
      but we're a proud one.

393
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:52,419
 And every man from Bear Island
 fights with the strength
 of 10 mainlanders.

394
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:56,556
 If they're half as
 ferocious as their lady,
 the Boltons are doomed.

400
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:22,476
 I assume you're here
 to fulfill the vow
 you gave my niece.

401
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:25,946
 I don't see Sansa and Arya.

402
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,981
             I don't have them.
 Pity.

403
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:32,085
 Do you wish to
 resume your captivity?

404
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,554
 Then why are you here?

405
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:36,456
         You know why I'm here.

406
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,124
         This castle
         belongs to House Frey.

00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,776
            You're trespassing.

408
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:42,596
 In the name of King Tommen,
 I order you to surrender or...

409
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:44,731
 Or you'll kill Edmure?

410
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,102
   My nephew's marked for death
   no matter what.

411
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:50,571
 Hang him and be done with it.

412
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:52,439
     It won't stop with Edmure.

413
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:54,408
             You'll force me to
             storm the castle.

414
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:56,577
             Hundreds will die.

415
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:59,946
       Hundreds of mine.
       Thousands of yours.

416
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:02,882
              If you can
              breach the walls.

417
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:06,503
 We'll breach them
 and kill every
 last one of you.

418
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,440
 But if you surrender,

419
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,943
 I'll spare
 the lives of your men.

420
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:14,377
 On my honor.

421
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,212
                    Your honor?

422
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:19,449
 Bargaining with oathbreakers
 is like building on quicksand.

423
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,417
 The war is over, ser.

424
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,487
 Why sacrifice living
 men to a lost cause?

425
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:33,613
       As long as I'm standing,
       the war is not over.

426
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,050
               This is my home.

427
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,253
    I was born in this castle
    and I'm ready to die in it.

428
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:43,156
       So you can either attack

429
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:47,127
       or try to starve us out.

430
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:49,396
      We have enough
      provisions for two years.

431
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:54,767
         Do you have two years,
         Kingslayer?

432
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,927
  You clearly have no intention
  of saving your men's lives.

433
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,111
            Why did you
            come treat with me?

434
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,899
 Sieges are dull.

435
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,035
 And I wanted to
 see you in person,
 get the measure of you.

436
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:14,737
            Well, now you have.

437
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,890
 Aye, now I have.

438
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,442
 I'm disappointed.

439
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,681
 (CLANKING)

440
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:31,088
   GLOVER: The answer is no.

441
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:32,638
 Lord Glover, if you
 could just hear us out.

442
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,224
             I've heard enough.

443
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,927
         We've only just
         taken back this castle
         from the ironborn.

444
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:39,162
   The Boltons helped us do it.

445
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,031
            Now you want me to
            fight against them?

446
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,083
       I could be skinned
       for even talking to you.

447
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,485
 The Boltons are traitors.
 Roose Bolton...

448
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:48,421
     Have other northern houses
     pledged to fight for you?

450
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:54,411
                    And?

451
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,079
          We sent ravens to
          Houses Manderly...

452
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,847
                  I don't care
                  about ravens.

453
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,451
             You're asking me
             to join your army.

454
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,270
                Who is fighting
                in this army?

455
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:12,562
 The bulk of the force
 is made up of wildlings.

      Then the rumors are true.

00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,087

       I received you out of
       respect for your father.

460
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:30,497
             Now I would
             like you to leave.

461
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:33,667
  House Glover will not abandon
  its ancestral home

462
00:32:33,736 --> 00:32:36,370
  to fight alongside wildlings.

463
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,290
 Lord Glover...
   There's nothing else to say.

464
00:32:40,342 --> 00:32:44,961
 I would remind you
 that House Glover
 is pledged to House Stark.

        When my brother was
        lord of this castle,
        he answered Robb's call

470
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,254
             and hailed him
             King in the North.

471
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:22,032
        And where was King Robb
        when the ironborn
        attacked this castle?

472
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:25,685
        When they threw my wife
        and children in prison

473
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,755
           and brutalized and
