                  My lord.

132
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:09,984
           My lord, I have
           always been faithful
           to House Arryn.

133
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:12,953
             To your father,
             to your mother,
             and now to you.

134
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:15,339
            Do you believe him,
            Uncle Petyr?

135

          (SCREECHING)

136
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,435
 Lord Royce has
 served the Vale well.

137
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:30,788
 He's enjoyed
 a distinguished
 military career.

138
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,475
 If we could trust
 his absolute loyalty,

139
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,895
 he would make
 a capable commander
 in the wars to come.

140
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,318
           You can trust
           my absolute loyalty,
           my lord.

141
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:46,887
 I think he deserves
 one more chance.
 What do you say?

142
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:55,429
                  Fine.

143
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:05,323
             I bring good news.

144
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,876
 My friends in the North
 tell me Sansa has
 escaped Winterfell.

145
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:12,229
 I expect she's headed to
 Castle Black where her brother
 serves as Lord Commander.

146
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,499
   But she won't
   be safe there.

147
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,600
 Not with
 the Boltons after her.

               She's my cousin.

150
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,258
            We should help her.

151
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,826
    That was
    my instinct as well.

152
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,496
      Our lord has spoken.

153

      Gather the Knights
      of the Vale.

154
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,920
      The time has come
      to join the fray.

       (BIRDS SCREECHING)

156
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,959
    GREY WORM: You invite
    the enemy into our city.

157
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,027
         TYRION: I did.

158
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,114
           As a clever man
           once told me,

159
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,867
       "We make peace
       with our enemies,
       not our friends."

160
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,905
    I don't make peace
    with the queen's enemies.
    I kill the queen's enemies.

161
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,573
    Yes, that's the
    military approach.

162
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,641
           And how has
           that worked here
           in Meereen?

163
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,576
               I represent
               the diplomatic
               approach.

164
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,980
 Our queen tried to make
 peace with the Masters,
 and they tried to murder her.

165
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,435
                We enter these
                negotiations
                with open eyes.

166
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:09,404
                      Trust me.

167
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:12,423
 My own recent experience
 with slavery has taught me the
 horrors of that institution.

168
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,142
   How many days
   were you a slave?

              enough to know.

170
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,997
    Not long enough
    to understand.

171
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:29,273
       I bought this dwarf
       for a single gold honor.

172
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:34,712
      And somehow, you've risen
      to the top of the Great
      Pyramid of Meereen.

173
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,697
     It's most impressive.

174
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,400
            And now you speak
            for the Good
            Masters of Astapor.

175
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:41,619
            Here's to reversals
            of fortune.

176
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,254
                We came here to
                meet the queen,

177
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,923
      and instead we're greeted
      by a dwarf and a eunuch.

178
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,825
         TYRION: Let's make
         this simple, shall we?

179
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,078
         Tell me what you want.

180
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:52,813
  We want you to
  leave Slaver's Bay.

181
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:56,701
  Take your dragons
  and your mercenaries
  and go.

182
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,603
             Queen Daenerys
             won't stay in
             Meereen forever.

183
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,272
             Her path takes
             her westward.

184
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,724
 When we last met,
 I offered her ships,

185
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:06,493
  so she could
  return to Westeros
  where she belongs.

186
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:07,829
  She refused them.

187
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:09,430
             She refused them
             because hundreds
             of thousands

188
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:11,799
     of men, women and children
     still lived in chains.

189
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:14,369
 As they have since
 the dawn of time.

190
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,436
                   Not anymore.

191
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,654
         Oh, you think
         you're a free man now?

192
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,623
              You still
              follow orders.

193
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,226
       Just because your master
       has silver hair and tits

194
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,944
            doesn't mean
            she's not a master.

195
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:25,880
              Friends, friends.
              Friends.

196
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,099
                        Please.

197
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:32,436
    There have always been
    those with wealth and power
    and those with nothing.

198
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,173
  That is the way of the world.
  I'm not here to change
  the way of the world.

199
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,825
                 Slavery is
                 the way of
                 our world.

200
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:41,612
          You don't need slaves
          to make money.

201
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,281
         There haven't been
         slaves in Westeros
         for hundreds of years,

202
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,300
           and I grew up richer
           than any of you.

203
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:52,423
       But our queen recognizes
       that she erred

204
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:57,945
        by abolishing slavery
        without providing a new
        system to replace it.

205
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:00,381
              So, here is the
              queen's proposal.

206
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,718
             Slavery will never
             return to Meereen,

207
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:07,521
              but she will give
              the other cities
              of Slaver's Bay

208
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,456
             time to adjust
             to the new order.

209
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,992
           What does that mean?

210
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,495
          Instead of abolishing
          slavery overnight,

211
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:16,881
             we will give you
             seven years to end
             the practice.

212
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:26,791
  Slaveholders will be
  compensated for their losses,
  of course, at fair prices.

213
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:31,229
       In exchange, you will
       cut off your support for
       the Sons of the Harpy.

214
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,930
         We do not support
         the Sons of the Harpy.

215
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,917
       Fine, fine, but you will
       cut it off all the same.

216
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:39,987
          I do hope you accept,
          my friends.

217
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:42,523
           You will not receive

                   Give freedom

        every bit as good
        as what came before.

226
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,573
             Perhaps I should
             translate for you.

      Our brothers and sisters
      died fighting these scum.

232

          Now you invite them
          to our city and drink
          wine with them?

233
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:50,824
 TYRION: I imagine
 this room was built

234
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,876
 so the rulers could
 intimidate the ruled.

       You are a stranger here.

        with our enemies?

241
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,766
      Because our queen
      chose me as her advisor.

242
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,485
         Until she returns
         from her travels...

243
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,086
        When does she return?

244
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:21,755
 Soon. You have my word.

245

00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:38,391
 Time, most of all.

380
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,161
 Dozens of hours
 spent on a single pair.

381
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,979
            Quality takes time.

382
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,998
        (CHUCKLES) Yes.

383
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:50,303
  I imagine you've worn
  a year of someone's
  life on your back.

384
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,773
 The highborn liked
 to cover their feet
 with my time,

385
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:56,192
 and they paid well
 for the privilege.

386
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:01,364
 I used their money
 to buy a taste of
 their lives for myself.

387
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:06,853
 Each time I indulged,
 I felt myself ascending
 to something better.

388
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:08,922
        And one day, you walked
        through a graveyard

389
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:10,724
            and realized it was
            all for nothing,

390
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:13,527
         and set out on the
         path to righteousness.

391
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:16,697
          Book of the Stranger,
          verse 25.

392
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:18,665
 You know The
 Seven-Pointed Star.

393
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,401
             Septa Unella reads
             it to me. At me.

394
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:25,238
 Yes, yes, she does
 enjoy reading at people.

395
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:28,375
 You're close.

396
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:31,945
 But it wasn't
 a graveyard.

397
00:30:32,014 --> 00:30:33,546
 It was a feast.

398
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:38,284
 I bought old fine wine
 and young pretty girls,

399
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:41,854
 and invited my friends
 to come and share it all.

400
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,492
 We passed around the wine,
 passed around the women,

401
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:48,094
 and soon we fell
 into a stupor.

402
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,300
 I woke before dawn.

403
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,537
 I could barely stand.

404
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:01,341
 Everyone else was asleep on
 the couches or on the floor,

405
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:07,281
 lying in heaps next
 to their fine clothes.

406
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:09,650
 The truth of their
 bodies laid bare.

407
00:31:11,687 --> 00:31:13,253
 I could smell them

408
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,358
 beneath the incense
 and the perfume,

409
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:22,128
 and the fine food
 that had already
 started to turn.

410
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,667
 And I saw it with
 perfect clarity.

411
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:31,905
 I saw what my sins were.

412
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,874
   The gold I had,
   the wine I drank,
   the women I used,

413
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:39,212
 my ceaseless struggle
 to maintain my position.

414
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:45,919
 It was all part of a story.

415
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:52,292
 A story I was telling
 myself about who I was.

416
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:56,496
 A collection of lies
 that would disappear
 in the light.

417
00:31:56,565 --> 00:32:00,416
 The people I was trying
 to climb away from,

418
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,620
 the beggars in the street,
 the poor,

419
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,340
 they were closer to
 the truth than I ever was.

420
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:09,076
          So, what did you do?

421
00:32:10,112 --> 00:32:12,378
 I left to go
 and find them.

422
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,714
  I didn't even
  put on my shoes.

423
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:17,884
 I walked out the door

424
00:32:17,953 --> 00:32:19,569
 and never went back.

425
00:32:25,327 --> 00:32:27,311
        Come, let's go
        and see him.

426
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,429
                 Who?

427
00:32:29,498 --> 00:32:30,730
  Your brother.

428
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,393
 (DOOR LOCKS)

429
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,131
             Loras.

430
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:56,389
                 Loras.

431
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,188
           (SOBBING)

432
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,460
                  Listen to me.

433
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,362
       You need to stay strong.

434
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,600
   I can't stay strong.

435
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,139
 I never was strong.
                You are strong.

436
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:33,109
          You are the future
          of our house, the
          future of our family.

437
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,577
 I don't care about that.

438
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,681
                   Shh! Shh.

439
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:41,517
       Have you told them that?
       That you don't care?

440
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,488
 I just want it to stop.

441
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,492
    Help me.

442
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,128
           (SOBBING)

443
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:00,436
                   They want me
                   to help you.

444
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,506
           They want me to help
           tear you down.

445
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:06,509
            That's why he's
            letting me see you.
            I know it is.

446
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:10,046
           And if either of us
           give in to what they
           want, then they win.

447
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:11,815
      Let them win.

448
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,318
    Just make it stop.

449
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,453
   Please.

00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:20,090
        (SOBBING)

451
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,324
                 All right.

452
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:29,915
 PYCELLE: And now, how
 to avert disaster with
 our current predicament.

453
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,984
 This High Sparrow.

454
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:35,021
 I have dealt with
 fanatics of every
 description, Your Grace.

455
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:38,824
 Not setting them off,
 that's the most
 important thing.

456
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,827
 You are beset with enemies,
 both within and without.

457
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:43,296
               What are you
               doing here?

458
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:49,936
 I am advising
 the king on our
 current predicament.

459
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:54,190
          Leave.
 I am a member of
 the Small Council.

460
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,277
       The king...
       Is this a Small
       Council meeting?

461
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,578
      Obviously not.

462
00:34:58,646 --> 00:35:01,948
 I'm here to lend my
 wisdom and my support.

463
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:05,418
                 Thank you for
                 your counsel,
                 Grand Maester.

464
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:07,720
                   That will be
                   all for now.

465
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:08,989
         Your Grace.

466
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:36,949
         Since I've missed
         the past several Small
         Council meetings,

467
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:39,386
              I wanted to speak
              to you about
              a few things.

468
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:43,889
        I've been thinking
        about the High Sparrow.

469
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,225
 As have we all,
 unfortunately.

470
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:49,128
             We need to be
             careful in dealing
             with such a man.

471
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,199
        To prevent things from
        escalating any further.

472
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,353
         We have to be careful
         not to antagonize him.

473
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,638
               He has Margaery.

474
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,723
                We can't put
                her at risk.
                He's dangerous.

475
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,708
 Look at me.

476
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:04,710
 What did they do to me?

477
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,595
 To the king's own mother?

478
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,084
     It's all right.

479
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:16,923
 It's done.
 It's in the past.

480
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:20,793
    And of course,
    Margaery's safety
    is paramount.

481
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:26,749
              You don't like
              Margaery, do you?

482
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:31,570
 Whether I like her or not
 is completely unimportant.

483
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:36,008
 Margaery is the queen.

484
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:40,530
 Queens must command respect.
 Kings even more so.

485
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,533
 Not just for
 their own sake,
 but for everyone's.

486
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:49,038
 The High Sparrow
 has no respect
 for kings or queens.

487
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,857
 No respect for anything
 in this world.

488
00:36:50,926 --> 00:36:53,759
 He has no use for the
 things of this world.

489
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:57,596
 He wants to knock them down,
 and replace them with what?

490
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,732
   With fantasies.

491
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,650
 With beggars
 in the street.

492
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,985
     With nothing.

493
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:05,972
                   Mother.

494
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:09,792
            There's something
            I want to tell you.

495
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,530
             Something the High
             Sparrow told me.

496
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,034
 You've spoken with him?

497
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:23,773
        I promised him
        I wouldn't tell anyone.
        If he found out...

498
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:26,242
 It would be a breach
 of confidence which
 he would not take lightly,

499
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:29,245
 given his constant
 prattling about the truth.

500
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,834
 I am your mother.

501
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:37,904
 You can always trust me.

502
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:44,027
                   (DOOR OPENS)

503
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,532
      The Small Council meeting
      has been postponed
      on the king's orders.

504
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,135
 I would have thought
 we were perfectly
 clear the first time.

505
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,336
 You're not welcome.

506
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:55,071
 You once spoke of your
 respect for our father

507
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,074
 because he understood
 the necessity of working
 with one's rivals.

508
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:03,113
 My dear, you have
 been stripped of your
 dignity and authority,

509
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:06,866
 publically shamed
 and confined
 to the Red Keep.

510
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,334
    (CHUCKLES) What's
    left to work with?

511
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:10,837
        JAIME: Cersei is
        the mother of the king.

512
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:13,739
         She has the king's ear
         and his trust.

513
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:16,842
        And the king has
        been speaking regularly
        with the High Sparrow

514
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:19,245
           about Queen Margaery
           and Ser Loras.

515
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:21,414
  The High Sparrow seized
  power knowing full well

516
00:38:21,483 --> 00:38:24,617
   we'd bicker amongst
   ourselves instead
   of seizing it back.

517
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:27,136
      Here we are.
      Well done to us.

518
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:31,040
    Now the future of the
    Seven Kingdoms rests
    in his dirty peasant hands.

519
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,876
 In a few days,
 he'll have
 a trial for me.

520
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:38,147
 But before that,
 Queen Margaery will make
 her walk of atonement.

521
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:43,036
 Yes, Margaery will repent
 her sins before the good
 people of the city.

522
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:44,920
          Oh, no.

523
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,723
    That cannot happen.

524
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,609
   That will not happen.

525
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:52,011
     I agree.

526
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,766
             You've got
             the second largest
             army in Westeros.

527
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,502
              You'll bring them
              into the city,

528
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,121
 stop Queen Margaery's
 humiliation before it starts,

529
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,724
            and take her back
            into Crown custody.

530
00:39:04,793 --> 00:39:07,427
 The king has ordered me
 to take no action

531
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:10,079
       against the High Sparrow
       or the Faith Militant

532
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,647
        out of fear for
        the queen's safety.

533
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,649
     You will take
     no action at all.

534
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:17,269
 When the Tyrell armies come,
 you will stand down.

535
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:20,339
             Were you expressly
             forbidden from
             standing down?

536
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:22,958
 No, but if the king
 should call...

537
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,112
  The whole thing will be over
  before anyone can call
  on you to do anything.

538
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:29,932
          When the High Sparrow
          is in custody,
          or dead, preferably,

539
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,735
            and Margaery's back
            at Tommen's side,

540
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,188
   do you think
   the king will be angry
   at the outcome?

541
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:38,491
               You hate these
               fanatics as much
               as we do.

542
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,060
              You hate what
              they've done
              to your son.

543
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:44,864
       Do you want Lancel back?
       Or have you given
       him up for good?

544
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:48,918
 Of course I want him back.

545
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,973
               Then stand aside

546
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:57,743
             and let the people
             that took him from
             you be destroyed.

547
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:05,535
 If it doesn't go as planned,
 the Sparrows have many
 friends in this city.

548
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:08,137
 We'll have civil war.
 Many will die.

549
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:10,439
 Many will die
 no matter what we do.

550
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:13,927
 Better them than us.

 you were home, and
 I didn't believe it.

       "Theon Greyjoy?" I said.

                "He's been dead

557
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,867
                 He let you go?

558
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:29,068
      I escaped.

559
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,706
              I can't hear you.

560
00:41:33,775 --> 00:41:35,241
       I escaped.

561
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:39,411
        Look at me.

                  I'm sorry.

 You were my brother.

 You were a spoiled
 little cunt, but you
 were my brother,

569
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:08,057
 and I risked
 everything for you.

570

    Why did you
    come here?

579
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,782
                    Where else
                    could I go?

580

 dead and you thought
 you'd claim the crown?

581

       No. No, I only heard
       he died after we docked.

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,207
 You happen to show up
 on Pyke right before

 wants you to be king?

 anymore. Stop crying.

 what you want.

                 Aye.

609
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,849
          They put me in chains
          and put a sword
          at my throat,

610
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,283
            so I served them.

   The Starks have been
   gone for a long time,

    but you kept
    protecting Rickon.

613

           I served his family
