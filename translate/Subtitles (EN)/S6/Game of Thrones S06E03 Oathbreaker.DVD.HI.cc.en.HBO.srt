 kill me or they do.

             be talking about

 patrol with the Unsullied.

238
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,462
 What we see on patrol.
 Who we captured on patrol.

239
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:24,197

           I was thinking more
           of a conversation.

241

243

244
00:26:41,384 --> 00:26:43,583
   Me. Just now.

245
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:54,494
 All right, no conversations.
 Let's play a game.

246
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,833
       You don't play games?
       Either one of you, ever?

247

 for children.

            make us play games.

249
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,590
         There, that's a start.

250
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:08,642
     Only the girls.

251
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,044
                 Oh...
                 No, no, no.

252
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,148
                Not that.
                Of course,

 who funds the

 you can't rush.

00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:59,359
 The Good Masters
 of Astapor and the
 Wise Masters of Yunkai.

269
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,262
 With help from their
 friends in Volantis.

           You don't even
           have to worry about
           the local rebellion.

272
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:10,187
  We only have to worry
  about the three rich
  foreign cities paying for it.

273
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,888
           We conquered Astapor
           and Yunkai once.

274
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,091
       We will do it again
       and execute the Masters.

275

         If the Unsullied march
         off to re-conquer
         Astapor and Yunkai,

             to defend the free
             people of Meereen?

00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,381
 If we do not fight them,
 how can we stop them?

278
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,349
                  We cannot.

             only one language.

             me for many years.

         I know it better
         than my mother tongue.

282
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:33,927
         If we want them
         to hear us, we must
         speak it back to them.

283
00:28:33,996 --> 00:28:35,845
          May it be the last
          thing they ever hear.

284
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,398
            You may be right.

285
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,300
 So we will
 fight them?

              your little birds
              get a message

289
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:50,844

         and benevolent
         enslavers of Volantis?

 Of course. Men can
 be fickle, but birds
 I always trust.

          Better.

               rather nicely.

             I want you to let
             her see Myrcella's
             resting place.

387
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,759
               I am the king.

388
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,027
      You are.

389
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,332
           And what does
           that mean to you?

390
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,900
 It means
 a great deal to me.

391
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:08,504
 The Crown and the
 Faith are the twin
 pillars of the world.

392
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:09,890
 Do you know
 who told me that?

393
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:13,226
      Your mother.

394
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:15,812
           My mother
           who is unclean?

395
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,032
      My mother who still needs
      to atone after all
      you've put her through?

396
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,439
    How do you think
    the Mother Above
    first came to us?

397
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:47,510
 How did men and women
 first come to feel the
 Mother's presence, hmm?

398
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,713
 It was through
 their own mothers.

399
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:57,169
    There's a great deal
    of falsehood in Cersei.
    You know that.

400
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,257
   But when she speaks
   of you, the Mother's
   love outshines it all.

401
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:08,431
    Her love for you is more
    real than anything
    else in this world

402
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,300
     because it doesn't
     come from this world.

403
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,320
       But you know that.

404
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,540
      You've felt it.

405
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,191
 You've seen her
 when she talks to you.

406
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:22,529
                   Yes.

407
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,632
     It's a great gift.
     One I never had.

   for me to atone for.

411
00:36:34,576 --> 00:36:36,776
   Your Grace, do you...
   May I? Do you mind?

412
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,512
        It's my knees.

  made her walk
  of atonement,

415
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:53,593
   she did it to
   get back to you.

416
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:55,996
       I still don't understand
       why you want to put her

417
00:36:56,064 --> 00:36:57,664
         through any more than
         she's already endured.

418
00:36:57,732 --> 00:37:01,684
 It's not what I want.
 It's what the gods want.

419
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:05,905
 They make their will known
 to us, and it's up to us
 to either accept or reject it.

 good, then we accept it.
 All of us, even kings.

            about the gods.

426
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:39,672
 The gods worked through him
 whether he knew it or not.

427
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,143
 As they work
 through your mother.

          the same to my father

              You think a horde
              of wildlings can
              take Winterfell?

503
00:44:16,704 --> 00:44:18,637
           If they get Jon Snow
           leading them, maybe.

504
00:44:18,706 --> 00:44:20,573
      He knows this place
      better than we ever will.

505
00:44:24,512 --> 00:44:26,712
   Pledge your banners
   to House Bolton,

506
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:29,181
    swear loyalty to me
    as Warden of the North,

507

  and all his wildling friends.

509

          your fucking hand.

 kneels before his lord.

     I'm not doing that either.

512

00:44:53,474 --> 00:44:55,624
    Then it appears we're
    at a bit of an impasse.

517
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:59,879
           Fuck kneeling and
           fuck oaths. I've got
           a gift for you.

518
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:06,251
 A girl, I hope.
 I prefer redheads.

519
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,120
        A girl, aye.

520
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,589
       (SMALLJON LAUGHS)

521
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:11,824
          A wild one.

522
00:45:20,368 --> 00:45:21,633
       I like them wild.

523
00:45:23,004 --> 00:45:26,705
            And a boy,
            nice and young.

524
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:28,040
          The way Karstark
          likes them.

525
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:32,678
                   (PANTING)

526
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:37,766
 Who's this?
    Rickon Stark.

527
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:47,509
  How do I know
  that's Rickon Stark?

528
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:21,360
                Welcome home,
                Lord Stark.

529
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,032
 (POUNDING ON DOOR)

530
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:34,106
 It's time.

531
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,698
 If you have
 any last words,
 now is the time.

532
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:18,283
    You shouldn't be alive.
    It's not right.

533
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,354
        Neither was killing me.

534
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:31,797
        My mother's still
        living at White Harbor.
        Could you write her?

535
00:47:31,866 --> 00:47:33,449
        Tell her I died
        fighting the wildlings.

536
00:47:42,676 --> 00:47:46,478
               I had a choice,
               Lord Commander.

537
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:50,582
           Betray you or betray
           the Night's Watch.

538
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:53,102
           You brought
           an army of wildlings
           into our lands.

539
00:47:55,322 --> 00:47:58,224
           An army of murderers
           and raiders.

540
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:02,328
     If I had to do it all over
     knowing where I'd end up,

541
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:05,730
            I pray I'd make the
            right choice again.

542
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,416
      I'm sure you would,
      Ser Alliser.

543
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:10,285
              I fought, I lost.

544
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,323
                 Now I rest.

545
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:18,343
            But you, Lord Snow,

546
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,797
         you'll be fighting
         their battles forever.

547
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,834
 (BREATHING DEEPLY)

548
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:24,009
 (CHOKING, GASPING)

549
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:10,489
   We should burn
   the bodies.

550
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:13,725
              You should.

551
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:25,404
    What do you want
    me to do with this?

552
00:50:25,472 --> 00:50:27,672
          Wear it. Burn it.

553
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,459
             Whatever you want.

554
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:32,862
        You have Castle Black.

555
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:41,303
          My watch is ended.
