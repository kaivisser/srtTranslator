         Come in.
          (DOOR OPENS)

528
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,409
      I'm sorry, my lady.
      Didn't mean to interrupt.

529
00:44:24,512 --> 00:44:26,212
  You interrupt nothing.

530
00:44:38,393 --> 00:44:41,060
         I assume you know
         why I'm here.

531
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:44,863
   I will after you tell me.

532
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,566
          It's about
          the Lord Commander.

533
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:48,468
  The former Lord Commander.

534
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:51,571
         Does he have to be?

535
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:57,009
   What are you asking?

536
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:05,084
       Do you know of any magic

537
00:45:06,654 --> 00:45:08,020
           that could help him?

538
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,389
             Bring him back?

539
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,592
 If you want to help him,
 leave him be.

540
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,959
             Can it be done?

541
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,563
     There are some
     with this power.

542
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,132
                           How?

543
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,199
 (SOFTLY) I don't know.

544
00:45:20,268 --> 00:45:21,267
         Have you seen it done?

545
00:45:25,173 --> 00:45:27,140
  I met a man who came
  back from the dead,

546
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:28,974
  but the priest
  who did it...

547
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:32,278
   It shouldn't
   have been possible.

548
00:45:32,347 --> 00:45:35,515
               But it was.
               It could be now.

549
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:37,883
          Not for me.

550
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:43,822
                   Not for you?

551
00:45:48,563 --> 00:45:52,265
             I saw you drink
             poison that should
             have killed you.

552
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,767
           I saw you give birth
           to a demon made
           of shadows.

553
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,770
   Everything I believed,

554
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,939
 the great victory
 I saw in the flames...

555
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,675
 (SHAKILY)
 All of it was a lie.

556
00:46:07,415 --> 00:46:09,649
 You were right all along.

557
00:46:09,717 --> 00:46:11,651
      The Lord never
      spoke to me.

558
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:13,786
                Fuck him, then.

559
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,188
              Fuck all of them.

560
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:21,294
          I'm not a devout man,
          obviously.

561
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,730
            Seven gods, drowned
            gods, tree gods,
            it's all the same.

562
00:46:28,135 --> 00:46:31,304
        I'm not asking the
        Lord of Light for help.

563
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:35,107
           I'm asking the woman
           who showed me
           that miracles exist.

564
00:46:37,512 --> 00:46:39,645
   I never had this gift.

565
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,146
           Have you ever tried?
