00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,247
   Did you tell them
   how far north?

57

      Well, it wasn't a very
      large piece of parchment.

58
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,085
 You didn't tell them
 where I'm really from?

59
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,853
 You didn't tell them
 I'm a wildling?

                The thing is...

61
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,542
              My father doesn't
              like wildlings.

62
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,079

        some bloody wildlings,"

63
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:48,449

 He's not quite what we
 thought he was, is he?

133
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:14,182
 (CHUCKLES) You think
 I'm mad. I sound mad.

134
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:18,035
             No. No, you don't.

135
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,503
               You could never.

136
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,206
                  You're right,
                  he's not.

137
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,373
             He's a lot more...

138
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:24,992
        He is.

139
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,061
  There's something
  about him.

140
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:29,129
 His way of looking
 at the world.

141
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:36,671
 It's not an easy thing,
 admitting to yourself
 what you really are.

142
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,940
 It's taken me a while.

143
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,608
 He's helped me.

144
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,211
               What are you
               talking about?

145
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,346
          You're a good person.

146
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:47,165
             You've always been
             a good person.

147
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,768
 You're the best
 person I know.
                    (LAUGHS)

148
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,437
 I was just telling
 him about your
 devotion to the poor.

149
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,589
      Ah, yes, I visited
      their hovels,

150
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:58,860
  and I fed them soup,
  and I made sure
  I was seen doing it.

151
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,694
 (BOOK THUDDING)

152
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:04,164
   I never gave them
   what they really
   needed, though.

153
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:10,037
 I've had lots of time
 to think about how good
 I was at seeming good.

154
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:12,807
   All those stories
   I told myself
   about who I was

155
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,644
   and why I did
   the things I did.

156
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,313
    There were so many
    lies in those stories.

157
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:22,816
            I don't understand.

158
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,903
    It's all right.
    It really is.

159
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,474
 It's such a relief
 to let go of those lies.

160
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,729
              What about Loras?

161
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,884
 I love my brother.

162
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,919
 I will always
 love my brother.

163
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:48,192
 His soul is pure
 and perfect.

164
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:52,663
 His sins don't
 erase that purity,
 they only obscure it.

165
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:58,002
 He just needs
 to atone for them.

166
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,904
     We all do.

167
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,941
 Sooner or later,
 one way or another.

168
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,177
  The gods have
  a plan for us all.

169
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,063
        It's hard
        to walk in this.

170
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,850
              It's beautiful.

171
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:32,920
             You're beautiful.

172
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:24,321
               This venison,
               it's very tasty.

173
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,040
                Is it from
                today's hunt?

174
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:29,777
 Well, no.
 We haven't been able
 to cure that one yet.

175
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,298
 This is last week's.

176
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,399
                Oh, uh...
                (CHUCKLES)

177
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,567
                Of course.
                Sorry.

178
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,986
               Long journey.
                      (GIGGLES)

179
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:40,688
 Brought it down
 from 70 yards.

180
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:41,839
    One shot.

181
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,376
               Oh! That's
               a fair distance.

182
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,246
 So do you do much
 hunting up at the Wall?

183
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,665
                  Oh, yes. Yes.

184
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,719
                 A good amount.

185
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,339
             North of the Wall,
             you don't hunt,
             you don't eat.

186
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,692
 Mostly deer,
 or is it elk
 as well?

187
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:04,528
                  Rabbits.

188
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,199
           Sometimes squirrels.

189
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,089
               I say "we,"
               it's my friend
               Jon mostly.

190
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:16,924
                 Sometimes Edd.

191
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:19,243
                     And Gilly.

192
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:21,995
                  She's quite
                  a good hunter
                  as well.

193
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,699
    Huntress.

194
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,818
          LADY TARLY:
          I imagine it's common
          where you're from.

195
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:31,271
   We once met a man,
   Lord Umber from Last Hearth,
   wasn't it, Randyll?

196
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,091
             Who said he taught
             all his daughters
             how to hunt.

197
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,761
      TALLA: Your father
      taught you to hunt?

198
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,662
     Our father would
     never teach us.

199
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:42,133
 I think our father
 could learn a thing
 or two from your father.

200
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,484
     That's enough of that.

201
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:48,705
 Samwell, would you
 care for more bread?

202
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,041
                 Oh, um...

203
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,927
           Yes. Yes, please.
           Thank you, Mother.

204
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,749
 Not fat enough already?

205
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,432
            I traveled south
            under orders from
            the Lord Commander.

206
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,617
              He wants me to...
 I read your letter.

207
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:20,354
 You're to be
 a maester.

208
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:22,456
                    Yes.

209
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:26,627
          And once I have
          my chain, I'll return
          to Castle Black.

210
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:29,780
 I thought the
 Night's Watch might
 make a man of you.

211
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,400
 Something resembling
 a man at least.

212
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:38,506
 You managed to stay
 soft and fat.

213
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,778
 Your nose
 buried in books.

214
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:47,865
 Spending your life
 reading about the
 achievements of better men.

215
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,118
 I'll wager you still
 can't sit a horse
 or wield a sword.

216
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:54,288
 Randyll, to be Maester
 of the Night's Watch
 is a great honor.

217
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:56,557
              He can wield
              a sword.

218
00:17:58,528 --> 00:17:59,960
    He killed a Thenn.

219
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:03,997
      He killed
      a White Walker.

220
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,432
       (LAUGHING)

221
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,850
 There's no such thing.

222
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,873
           I saw it with my own
           eyes on our way down
           to Castle Black.

223
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,876
       He drove a dagger
       into the Walker's heart.

224
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:19,663
     He risked his own
     life to save mine
     more than once.

225
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,917
     He's a greater warrior
     than either of
     you will ever be.

226
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:28,288
 Your way down
 to Castle Black?

227
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,644
 Where did he kill
 a White Walker?

228
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,115
 Where are you from?

229
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,551
 How'd you come
 to meet my son?

230
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:45,523
 The Night's Watch
 came to our keep.

231
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,274
      Where?
                        Gilly.

232
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:49,427
 North of the Wall.
 North of the Wall?

233
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,649
   You're a wildling.

234
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,328
 The Seven Kingdoms have
 waged war against these
 savages for centuries,

235
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,998
 and here I sit,
 hosting one in my hall,

236
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:13,900
 thanks to my son.

237
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:17,938
        See that sword?

238
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,527
 It's called Heartsbane.

239
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,548
 It's been in our family
 for 500 years.

240
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:30,100
 It's Valyrian steel.

241
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,636
     Only a handful of them
     left in the world.

242
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:36,840
 It's supposed
 to go to my firstborn
 son after I die.

243
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:37,974
       To him.

244
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:43,480
 He will never
 wield that sword.

245
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,918
 If he were to become
 Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,

246
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,753
 it would be the
 end of this house.

247
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:54,759
 I took you for
 a Mole's Town whore
 when I saw you,

248
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,627
 and I made
 my peace with that.

249
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,379
 Who else would
 have him?

250
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:02,032
 But I overestimated him.

251
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,468
 No.

252
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,891
 It was a wildling whore
 that seduced my son.

253
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,362
  This you getting
  back at me, boy?

254
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,116
              Hmm?

255
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,802
 Bringing that to my table
 and making me dine with it?

256
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,791
 And you got what you
 were after, didn't you?

257
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,376
 A bastard.

258
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,328
 A half-breed bastard.

259
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,731
    Your invitation
    into our home.

260
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,750
       Come, my dear.
       Talla.

261
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,421
 I've lost my appetite.

262
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,088
      He dishonors us.

263
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,724
         You dishonor yourself.

264
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,899
 Your mother's a fine woman.
 You're not worthy of her.

265
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:59,239
 To please her, I'll take
 the wildling in. She can
 work in the kitchens.

266
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:02,059
 The bastard

     unfortunately for you.

526
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:40,053
   And I'll not leave
   this world until they all
   choke on that laughter.

527
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:41,888
 Take that castle back.

528
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:46,359
          He'll never
          yield, Father.

529
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:47,460
       Oh!

530
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:48,711
    He'll yield.

531
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,269
    You'll show him
    the knife you used

532
00:40:56,338 --> 00:41:00,039
  to kill Robb Stark's child
  in its whore mother's belly,

533
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:02,224
      and you'll show him
      the knife you used

534
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,560
      to open
      his niece's throat.

535
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,862
     And you'll remind him
     who it was

536
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:11,016
      that got married
      at the Red Wedding
      in the first place.

537
00:41:11,086 --> 00:41:12,351
         His nephew.

538
00:41:28,102 --> 00:41:30,686
 Cheer up,
 Lord Edmure.

539
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,888
 You're going home.

540
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:36,526
                 I'm being sent
                 to deal with
                 the Blackfish.

541
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,994
     Apparently Walder Frey
     can't manage it on his own

542
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,331
    because he's 400 years old.

543
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:45,501
  Sent me with an army
  to the Riverlands and a siege
  that could last months.

544
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:50,907
     Better you're elsewhere
     at the head of an army
     than in the Sept dungeons.

545
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,809
 I'm not going
 to the Riverlands.
 (POURING)

546
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,329
                 What, then?

547
00:41:57,398 --> 00:42:01,166
 I'm going to give Bronn
 the largest bag of gold
 anyone's ever seen

548
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:04,303
 and have him gather
 the best killers he knows.

549
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:07,573
 I'll take them to the
 Sept, and I'll remove
 the High Sparrow's head

550
00:42:07,642 --> 00:42:09,592
 and every other
 Sparrow head I can find.

551
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:10,743
                   You can't.

552
00:42:10,812 --> 00:42:13,629
 He has our son!
 He stole our son!

553
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,397
    He's torn our family apart.

554
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,733
     How should we treat people
     who tear us apart?

555
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:22,488
            We should treat
            them without mercy,
            and we will.

556
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:24,857
        But if you kill the
        High Sparrow, you won't
        leave the Sept alive.

557
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:27,260
       And without you,
       this is all for nothing.

558
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:31,697
            Stand at the head
            of our army
            where you belong,

559
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:34,066
       where father wanted you.

560
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,435
        Show our men where
        their loyalties belong.

561
00:42:36,504 --> 00:42:38,404
             Show them what
             Lannisters are,

562
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,707
             what we do
             to our enemies.

563
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:46,512
 And take that stupid
 little castle back because
 it's ours and because you can.

564
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,682
 You'll stand trial soon.
 I need to be here for you.

565
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:53,169
             It will be a trial
             by combat.

566
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,773
           I have the mountain.

567
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:01,027
         They've made us both
         stronger, all of them.

568
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:05,397
           They have no idea
           how strong we are.

569
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:07,066
                No idea what
                we're going
                to do to them.

570
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:20,446
              We've always
              been together.

571
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:23,149
             We'll always
             be together.

572
00:43:23,218 --> 00:43:25,518
            We're the only
            two people
            in the world.

573
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:47,440
          Why did you help us?

574
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:51,961
           The three-eyed raven
           sent for me.

575
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,162
 The three-eyed
 raven's dead.

576
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:55,731
  Now he lives again.

579
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:11,280
         When I last saw you,
         you were a boy.

580
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,417
 A fearless boy.

581
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,452
         Loved to climb
         the castle walls,
         frighten his mother.

582
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:19,771
               Who are you?

583
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:39,158
              Uncle Benjen.

584
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,946
    The last letter Jon
    wrote me said you had
    been lost beyond the Wall.

585
00:44:47,168 --> 00:44:51,970
         I led a ranging party
         deep into the North
         to find White Walkers.

586
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:54,340
               They found us.

587
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:57,727
      A White Walker
      stabbed me in the gut
      with a sword of ice.

588
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:02,231
 Left me there to die.

589
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,549
         To turn.

590
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:06,903
     The children found me.

591
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:09,588
     Stopped the Walker's
     magic from taking hold.

592
00:45:09,657 --> 00:45:11,290
             How?

593
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,275
      The same way they
      made the Walkers
      in the first place.

594
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:14,677
      You saw it yourself.

595
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:17,847
     Dragonglass.

596
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,567
  A shard of dragonglass
  plunged into your heart.

597
00:45:24,238 --> 00:45:27,289
           You are

             I didn't have time
             to learn. I can't
             control anything.

599

           to the world of men.

603
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,748
                When he does,

604
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:54,666
