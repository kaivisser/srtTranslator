00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:47,441
        CERSIE: Confess.
        It felt good.

144
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,511
                  Beating me,
                  starving me,

145
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:54,081
                frightening me,
                humiliating me.

146
00:18:56,953 --> 00:19:00,421
  You didn't do it because
  you cared about my atonement.

147
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,590
             You did it because
             it felt good.

148
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,225
                  I understand.

149
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,462
            I do things because
            they feel good.

150
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:15,369
 I drink because
 it feels good.

151
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:19,073
    I killed my husband
    because it felt good
    to be rid of him.

152
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:27,448
 I fuck my brother
 because it feels good
 to feel him inside me.

153
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:29,533
 I lie about
 fucking my brother

154
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,372
 because it feels good
 to keep our son safe
 from hateful hypocrites.

155
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,977
     I killed your High Sparrow

156
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,114
   and all his little Sparrows.

157

  All his septons,
  all his septas,

158
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,021
 all his filthy soldiers,

159
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,592
 because it felt good
 to watch them burn.

160
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,448
 It felt good to imagine
 their shock and their pain.

161
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:04,285
          No thought has ever
          given me greater joy.

 under the right circumstances.

      You've always been quiet.

165
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,829
    I said my face
    would be the last thing
    you saw before you died.

166
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,031
        Do you remember?

167
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,168
               Good.

168
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,372
 I'm glad to see your face.

169
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,410
  I'm ready to meet the gods.

170
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,678
         What?

171
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,282
          Now?

172

  You're not
  going to die today.

 You're not going to die

 This is Ser Gregor Clegane.

   He's quiet, too.

178

 Your gods have forsaken you.

           Maester Aemon became
           quite ill shortly
           after the election.

280
00:29:35,324 --> 00:29:36,756
        He's since passed away.

281
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:40,877
         Which is why I'm here.

282
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,283
 This is irregular.

283
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:50,803
        Yes, well, I suppose
        that life is irregular.

284
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,936
 CITADEL MAESTER:
 The archmaester will discuss
 these irregularities with you.

 In the meantime, you are
 permitted to use the library.

286
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,244
 Follow me.

287
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,982
 No women or children.

291
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,148
      When we had feasts,

292
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:18,351
       our family
       would sit up here

293
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:21,888
          and I'd sit
          down there.

294
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,393
 Could have been worse,
 Jon Snow.

295
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,729
 You had a family.

296
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:29,962
   You had feasts.

297
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:35,285
    Aye, you're right.
    I was luckier than most.

        What is that?

300
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,505
                Tell him.

301
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:01,511
           Tell him
           who it belonged to.

302
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:07,950
          The Princess Shireen.

303
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,569
                Tell him what
                you did to her.

304
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:14,124
                   Tell him!

305
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:21,648
               (VOICE BREAKING)
               We burned her
               at the stake.

306
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:35,978
                     Why?

307
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:40,350
 The army was trapped.
 The horses were dying.

308
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:41,584
 It was the only way.

309
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,870
           You burned
           a little girl alive!

310
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,371
 I only do what
 my Lord commands.

311
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,240
             If he commands you
             to burn children,
             your Lord is evil.

312
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,263
 We are standing here
 because of him.

313
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,301
 Jon Snow is alive
 because the Lord willed it.

314
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,122
           I loved that girl
           like she was my own.

315
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:05,292
            She was good.
            She was kind.
            And you killed her!

316
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,795
 So did her father.

317
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,615
  So did her mother.

318
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,137
 Her own blood knew
 it was the only way.

319
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:18,872
         The only way for what?

320
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,358
          They all died anyway.

321
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,428
           You told everyone
           Stannis was the one.

322
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,730
      You had him believing it,
      all of them fooled.

323
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,866
                  And you lied.
 I didn't lie!

324
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:33,386
  I was wrong.

325
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:36,055
                DAVOS: Aye,
                you were wrong.

326
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,543
          How many died because
          you were wrong?

327
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:49,368
          I ask your leave
          to execute this woman
          for murder.

328
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:51,104
       She admits to the crime.

329
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:55,975
  Do you have anything
  to say for yourself?

330
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:02,532
         I've been ready
         to die for many years.

331
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,919
  If the Lord was done with me,
  so be it, but he's not.

332
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:09,222
          You've seen the
          Night King, Jon Snow.

333
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,726
         You know the Great War
         is still to come.

334
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:16,546
          You know
          the army of the dead
          will be upon us soon.

335
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,015
         And you know I can
         help you win that war.

336
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,165
  Ride south today.

337
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:38,735
 If you return to the North,

338
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,070
 I'll have you hanged
 as a murderer.

339
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:01,791
            If you ever
            come back this way,

340
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,160
     I will execute you myself.

341
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:39,079
             I'm having
             the lord's chamber
             prepared for you.

342
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,582
   Mother and
   Father's room?

343
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:45,952
 You should take it.

344
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,338
               I'm not a Stark.

345
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:51,924
         You are to me.

346
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,813
 You're the Lady of Winterfell.

347
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,649
      You deserve it.
      We're standing here
      because of you.

348
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:04,938
      The battle was lost
      until the Knights
      of the Vale rode in.

349
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:06,706
   They came because of you.

350
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:14,280
       You told me Lord Baelish
       sold you to the Boltons.

351
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:16,048
 He did.
             And you trust him?

352
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:19,819
 Only a fool
 would trust Littlefinger.

353
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,942
            I should have
            told you about him,

354
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,278
           about the
           Knights of the Vale.

355
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,980
                 I'm sorry.

356
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,860
 We need to trust each other.

357
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,546
 We can't fight a war
 amongst ourselves.

358
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:50,233
 We have so many enemies now.

359
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,233
           Jon.

360
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,536
    A raven came
    from the Citadel.

361
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,139
    A white raven.

         (SIGHS)

363
00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:17,594
    Winter is here.

364
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,959
           Well, Father always
           promised, didn't he?

365
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:52,678
 OLENNA: The last time
 a Tyrell came to Dorne,
 he was assassinated.

366
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,482
 A hundred red scorpions,
 was it?

367
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,118
       ELLARIA: You have
       nothing to fear from us,
       Lady Olenna.

368
00:38:58,186 --> 00:39:00,320
 OLENNA: You murder
 your own prince,

369
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:02,155
 but you expect me
 to trust you?

370
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:05,174
           We invited you
           to Dorne because
           we needed your help.

371
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:07,360
             You came to Dorne
             because you needed
             our help.

372
00:39:08,296 --> 00:39:12,215
            What is your name
            again? Barbaro?

373
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,017
                      Obara.
               Obara.

374
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,486
           You look like
           an angry little boy.

375
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:19,321
       Don't presume to tell me
       what I need.

376
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,823
 Forgive my sister.

377
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,659
 What she lacks
 in diplomacy,
 she makes...

378
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,244
          Do shut up, dear.
          Anything from you?

379
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,180
                   No? Good.

380
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:30,033
     Let the grown women speak.

381
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:35,104
      The Lannisters
      have declared war
      on House Tyrell.

382
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:37,673
 They have declared war
 on Dorne.

383
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,127
 We must be allies now
 if we wish to survive.

384
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,848
            Cersei stole
            the future from me.

385
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,649
             She killed my son.

386
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,003
        She killed my grandson.

387
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:52,038
   She killed my granddaughter.

388
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:56,175
            Survival is not
            what I'm after now.

389
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:58,461
 ELLARIA:
 You're absolutely right.

390
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,797
 I chose the wrong words.

391
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,533
 It is not survival
 I offer.

392
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,935
 It is your heart's desire.

393
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,804
 (DINGING)

394
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:10,990
             And what is
             my heart's desire?

395
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:13,309
    Vengeance.

396
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:15,711
        Justice.

397
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:21,567
          Fire and blood.

398
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:30,109
    Your ships
    are nearly ready.

399
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,312
     I saw them
     painting the sails.

400
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,386
 I'm curious to see
 how the Dothraki do
 on the poison water.

401
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:42,054
              You're not coming
              with us.

402
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:46,325
 New strategy?

403
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:51,530
 You want the Second Sons
 to attack from the west coast?

404
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,467
 If we take Casterly Rock,

405
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,604
       the Lannisters will have
       nowhere to run when
       you hit King's Landing.

406
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:00,190
    You're not going
    to Westeros.

407
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:03,259
 You're staying here
 with the Second Sons.

408
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:05,895
     There's finally
     peace in Meereen.

409
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,714
   You will keep the peace
   while the people
   choose their own leaders.

410
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,167
                Fuck Meereen.

411
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,220
               Fuck the people.

412
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:16,256
              I'm here for you,
              not them.

413
00:41:16,324 --> 00:41:18,090
   DAENERYS:
   You promised me.

414
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:21,093
   "My sword is yours.
   My life is yours."

415
00:41:22,097 --> 00:41:25,582
 This is what I command.

416
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,952
 If I'm going to rule
 in Westeros, I'll need
 to make alliances.

417
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:33,422
 The best way to make alliances
 is with marriage.

418
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,711
           Who are you marrying
           this time?

419
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,315
 I don't know. Maybe no one.

420
00:41:42,384 --> 00:41:45,701
           But you need to lure
           all the noble houses
           to the table?

421
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,320
                Are you a queen
                or fish bait?

422
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:52,892
 I can't bring
 a lover to Westeros.

423
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:55,261
          A king wouldn't
          think twice about it.

424
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:58,113
 So that's what you want?
 To be my mistress?

425
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,899
                 I'm not proud.

426
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:03,869
     I don't care what perfumed
     aristocrat sits beside you
     in the throne room.

427
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:06,772
          I don't want a crown.
          I want you.

428
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,048
          I love you.

429
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,617
     And I make you happy.

430
00:42:19,387 --> 00:42:20,819
         You know I do.

431
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:26,392
          Bring me with you.
          Let me fight for you.

432
00:42:34,268 --> 00:42:35,351
         I can't.

433
00:42:45,513 --> 00:42:46,945
            The dwarf told you
            to do this?

434
00:42:47,014 --> 00:42:48,814
 DAENERYS: No one
 tells me to do anything.

435
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:52,251
                Clever fellow.
                Can't argue
                with his logic.

436
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,719
              I'm no use to you
              over there.

437
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:55,204
  Don't get angry.

438
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:58,507
         I'm not angry.
         I'm full of self-pity.

439
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,143
           Who comes after you?

440
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:03,362
         Who can ever follow
         Daenerys Stormborn,
         the Mother of Dragons?

441
00:43:03,431 --> 00:43:05,797
 A great number of women,
 I imagine.

442
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,990
     Specific orders
     will be left for you

443
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:17,293
    regarding the welfare
    of Meereen and
    the Bay of Dragons.

444
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,928
            The Bay of Dragons?

445
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:20,913
 We can't call it
 Slaver's Bay anymore,
 can we?

446
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:28,237
         You'll get that throne
         you want so badly,
         I'm sure of it.

447
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,424
               I hope it brings
               you happiness.

448
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:39,831
               I pity the lords
               of Westeros.

449
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,634
        They have no idea
        what's coming for them.

450
00:43:42,803 --> 00:43:45,204
 Farewell, Daario Naharis.

451
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,975
            How did he take it?

452
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,411
      No tears.

453
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,749
                  I know it was
                  hard for you.

454
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,851
          You turned away a man
          who truly loves you

455
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,621
         because he would
         have been a liability
         in the Seven Kingdoms.

456
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,993
        That's the kind of
        self-sacrifice that
        makes for a good ruler,

457
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,062
       if it's any consolation.

458
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:31,934
           It's not.

459
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,303
             No, I suppose not.

460
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:36,004
                  I'm terrible
                  at consoling.

461
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,289
         Yes, you really are.

462
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:47,149
          All right, how about
          the fact that this is
          actually happening?

463
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:52,321
         You have your armies,
         you have your ships,
         you have your dragons.

464
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:57,293
      Everything you've ever
      wanted since you were old
      enough to want anything,

465
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,228
                it's all yours
                for the taking.

466
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:03,165
                Are you afraid?

467
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,419
                       Good.

468
00:45:08,356 --> 00:45:10,923
                You're in the
                great game now.

469
00:45:10,992 --> 00:45:13,926
             And the great
             game's terrifying.

470
00:45:13,995 --> 00:45:17,763
     The only people who aren't
     afraid of failure are
     madmen like your father.

471
00:45:20,702 --> 00:45:22,368
  Do you know
  what frightens me?

472
00:45:24,038 --> 00:45:26,471
 I said farewell
 to a man who loves me.

473
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:29,959
 A man I thought
 I cared for.

474
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,329
   And I felt nothing.

475
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:37,483
   Just impatient
   to get on with it.

476
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,106
            He wasn't the first
            to love you

477
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,109
                and he won't
                be the last.

478
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:54,616
       Well, you have
       completely failed
       to console me.

479
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,021
           For what it's worth,

480
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,190
              I've been a cynic
              for as long as
              I can remember.

481
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,093
           Everyone's always
           asking me to believe
           in things.

482
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:09,131
                 Family, gods,
                 kings, myself.

483
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,035
          It was often tempting
          until I saw where
          belief got people.

484
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,039
               So I said,
               "No, thank you,"
               to belief.

485
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,375
            And yet, here I am.

486
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,498
              I believe in you.

487
00:46:28,269 --> 00:46:29,936
     It's embarrassing, really.

488
00:46:32,106 --> 00:46:34,406
        I'd swear you my sword,

489
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:36,041
          but I don't
          actually own a sword.

490
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:38,844
 It's your counsel I need.

491
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,497
                 It's yours.

492
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:42,881
               Now and always.

493
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:45,834
          Good.

494
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,821
     I, um...

495
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,591
 I had something
 made for you.

            are you?

 No, my lord.

        Didn't think so.

 They're here, my lord.

508
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:11,069
              Tell them
              to come here now.

00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,104

     Here, my lord.

 Forgive me, my lady.

 If you're at prayer.

 will this action help to make

539
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,207
 and into the world?

540
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:07,179
 And I only act
 if the answer is yes.

541
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:14,720
 A picture of me
 on the Iron Throne

542
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,358
 and you by my side.

543
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:31,487
         It's a pretty picture.

544
00:51:37,545 --> 00:51:40,746
       News of this battle will
       spread quickly through
       the Seven Kingdoms.

545
00:51:40,815 --> 00:51:44,282
               I've declared
               for House Stark
               for all to hear.

546
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:46,719
 You've declared for
 other houses before,
 Lord Baelish.

547
00:51:46,787 --> 00:51:49,588
 It's never stopped you
 from serving yourself.

548
00:51:49,657 --> 00:51:52,157
               The past is gone
               for good.

549
00:51:52,226 --> 00:51:54,560
         You can sit here
         mourning its departure

550
00:51:54,628 --> 00:51:56,862
             or you can prepare
             for the future.

551
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,930
                  You, my love,

552
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:01,834
                are the future
                of House Stark.

553
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:06,755
      Who should the North
      rally behind?

554
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:11,160
       A trueborn daughter
       of Ned and Catelyn Stark
       born here at Winterfell

555
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,362
        or a motherless bastard
        born in the South?

556
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,841
          BENJEN: This is where
          I leave you.

557
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,509
              You're not coming
              with us?

558
00:52:46,513 --> 00:52:48,613
 The Wall is not
 just ice and stone.

559
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:52,985
 Ancient spells were carved
 into its foundations.

560
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:56,956
  Strong magic

561
00:52:57,024 --> 00:53:00,225
 to protect men
 from what lies beyond.

562
00:53:00,293 --> 00:53:03,044
 And while it stands,
 the dead cannot pass.

563
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:04,930
              I cannot pass.

 (HORSE NICKERS)

565
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,832
 Where will you go?

566
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:25,717
        The Great War is coming

567
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,686
              and I still fight
              for the living.

568
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:31,973
            I'll do what I can,

569
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,410
              as long as I can.

570
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,484
                  Thank you,
                  Uncle Benjen.

571
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,520
 I wish you both good fortune.

     (BRANDON GRUNTS)

573
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:26,428
 Are you sure
 you're ready for this?

574
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,646
          I'm the
          Three-Eyed Raven now.

575
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,649
             I have to be ready
             for this.

00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:18,596
            Is that really you?

582
00:55:23,504 --> 00:55:25,270
            You're not a dream?

583
00:55:26,707 --> 00:55:28,540
 No, I'm not a dream.

584
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:31,743
        I'm here.

585
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,514
 Right here.

586
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:37,916
               I've missed you,
               big brother.

587
00:55:41,688 --> 00:55:43,688
 I've missed you, too.

590
00:55:54,734 --> 00:55:55,968
                       I'm not.

591
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:01,439
           I don't want to die.

592
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,144
 You're not going to die.

593
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,766
 Get her some water.

594
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,901
                  No, no water.
                  Just listen.
 Is there a maester?

595
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,803
             Listen to me, Ned.

              You know he will.

       You have to protect him.

               Promise me, Ned.

               Promise me, Ned.

604
00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:57,980
             Promise me.

605
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:34,282
 You can't expect
 Knights of the Vale to side
 with wildling invaders.

606
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:36,852
   TORMUND: We didn't invade.

607
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:38,186
     We were invited.

608
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:40,205
 Not by me.

609
00:57:40,274 --> 00:57:44,192
  The free folk, the
  Northerners, and the Knights
  of the Vale fought bravely,

610
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:47,262
  fought together, and we won.

611
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:51,934
       My father used to say
       we find our true friends
       on the battlefield.

612
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:54,469
                  CLEY CERWYN:
                  The Boltons
                  are defeated.

613
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:56,338
               The war is over.

614
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,273
               Winter has come.

615
00:57:58,342 --> 00:58:02,326
     If the maesters are right,
     it'll be the coldest one
     in a thousand years.

616
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:05,513
            We should ride home
            and wait out
            the coming storms.

617
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:06,998
   JON: The war is not over.

618
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,018
 And I promise you, friend,

619
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:13,155
  the true enemy won't
  wait out the storm.

620
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,989
 He brings the storm.

      (SCATTERED MURMURS)

622

 Your son was butchered
 at the Red Wedding,

623
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:38,680
   Lord Manderly,

624
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:40,482
   but you refused the call.

625
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,005
 You swore allegiance
 to House Stark, Lord Glover,

626
00:58:47,074 --> 00:58:49,657
  but in their hour
  of greatest need,

627
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,727
 you refused the call.

628
00:58:53,981 --> 00:58:56,765
 And you, Lord Cerwyn,

629
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,918
  your father was skinned alive
  by Ramsay Bolton.

630
00:58:59,986 --> 00:59:02,253
    Still you refused the call.

631
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:07,642
   But House Mormont remembers.

632
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,364
           The North remembers.

633
00:59:12,432 --> 00:59:16,034
          We know no king but
          the King in the North
          whose name is Stark.

634
00:59:18,938 --> 00:59:20,405
             I don't care
             if he's a bastard.

635
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:23,208
        Ned Stark's blood
        runs through his veins.

636
00:59:23,276 --> 00:59:27,112
            He's my king
            from this day
            until his last day.

 Lady Mormont speaks harshly

639
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:48,249
     and truly.

640
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:56,841
 My son died for Robb Stark,
 the Young Wolf.

641
00:59:56,910 --> 01:00:00,244
   I didn't think we'd find
   another king in my lifetime.

642
01:00:00,313 --> 01:00:02,747
      I didn't commit
      my men to your cause

643
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:05,150
      'cause I didn't want
      more Manderlys
      dying for nothing.

         The King in the North!

648
01:00:30,243 --> 01:00:33,078
        I did not fight
        beside you on the field

649
01:00:33,146 --> 01:00:36,998
         and I will regret that
         until my dying day.

650
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:40,669
           A man can only admit
           when he was wrong

651
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,320
           and ask forgiveness.

652
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:47,542
 There's nothing
 to forgive, my lord.

653
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:53,030
             There will be more

             And I will stand
             behind Jon Snow,
