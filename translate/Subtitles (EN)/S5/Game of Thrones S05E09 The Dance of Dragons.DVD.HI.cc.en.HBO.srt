            hoping the dragon
            would only see
            its own reflection.

82

 But the dragon saw a dumb man
 holding a mirrored shield.

   Anara.

             I assure you.

  Of course. Of course.

        These fresh?

 Come on, the lads are hungry.

293

 I'll tell you when we're done.

 wasn't hungry today.

309

    you're bringing

327

                      She will.

 don't you?

     Of course, she's my niece.

 I wasn't talking about her.

331
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,201
 You think I disapprove?

332
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,937
     Why?

333
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,806
 Because people disapprove
 of that sort of
 thing where you are from?

334
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:26,009
 They disapproved
 of Oberyn and me
 where you are from.

335
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:30,881
 Here, no one blinked an eye.

 no one would have

338

 It's always changing,

00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:43,894
 who we're supposed to love
 and who we're not.

340

 The only thing
 that stays the same
 is that we want who we want.

341

 I know your
 daughter had no part
 in the terrible thing

342
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:03,129
 that happened to
 the man I love.

 Perhaps even you
 are innocent of that.

            (TENT FLAP RUSTLES)

345
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,789
            Father.

346
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,560
     Aren't you cold?

347
00:28:36,165 --> 00:28:37,998
      No. What are you reading?

348
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:40,584
     The Dance of Dragons.

349
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:41,885
               What's it about?

350
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,203
 It's the story of the fight

351
00:28:43,272 --> 00:28:45,322
 between Rhaenyra Targaryen
 and her half-brother Aegon

352
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,607
 for control of
 the Seven Kingdoms.

353
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:50,911
  Both of them thought
  they belonged on
  the Iron Throne.

354
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,714
 When people started declaring
 for one of them or the other,

355
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:55,832
 their fight divided
 the kingdoms in two.

356
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,335
 Brothers fought brothers,
 dragons fought dragons.

357
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:05,074
 By the time it was over,
 thousands were dead.

358
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,228
 And it was a disaster
 for the Targaryens as well.

359
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:10,697
 They never truly recovered.

360
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:12,799
          The Dance of Dragons.

361
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:16,736
           Why is that a dance?

362
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,671
 It's just what they call it.

363
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,357
  Hmm. Doesn't make much sense.

364
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,292
  I think it's poetic.

365
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,851
         If you'd had to choose

366
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,055
    between Rhaenyra and Aegon,

367
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:38,608
     who would you have chosen?

368
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:41,278
 I wouldn't have chosen either.

369
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,947
  It's all the choosing
  sides that made
  everything so horrible.

370
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,266
        Sometimes
        a person has to choose.

371
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,604
     Sometimes
     the world forces his hand.

372
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:56,459
      If a man knows what he is

373
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,697
   and remains true to himself,

374
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:06,920
              the choice is
              no choice at all.

375
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:09,456
    He must fulfill his destiny

376
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,128
             and become who
             he is meant to be.

377
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:19,699
   However much he may hate it.

378
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,935
       It's all right.

      It doesn't matter.

 Don't let her do this.

 Please let go!

402
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:27,945
 Please!

 Hear us now, my Lord.

404

 SHIREEN: You can't do this!

405
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,714
 MELISANDRE: For you,
 we offer up this girl...

406

            Please!

407
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,217
  ...that you may
  cleanse her with your fire

408
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,235
             and that its light
             may lead our way.

409
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:38,405
 SHIREEN: No,
 please let me see my father.

410
00:32:38,474 --> 00:32:41,291
    If we don't act, we'll
    all starve here. All of us.

411
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:44,293
          But if we make
          this sacrifice...

00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:49,399
 Accept this token of
 our faith, my Lord,
 and lead us from the darkness.
