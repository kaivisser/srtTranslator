00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,028
             He was a good man.

00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,498
          DAENERYS:
          "Barristan the Bold,"
          they called him.

4
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,334
       He crossed
       a continent to serve me.

5
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:52,454
         He was a loyal friend.

6
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:56,124
 And he died in an alley,

7
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:59,194
 butchered by cowards
 who hide behind masks.

8
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,749
 We could pull back to
 the pyramid district,

 and use it as a base
 from which to operate.

          I am Lord Commander
          of the Night's Watch.

00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:25,857

   and bring them back here.

  and let them through.

   settle south of the Wall.

 to kneel for me.

 when the time comes.

    The day I ask my people
    to fight with the crows

99
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,953
   is the day my people
   cut my guts from my belly

100
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,454
     and make me eat them.

           people can't fight?

    what happens to them?

   them to death.

   because you're too
   proud to make peace.

   Or maybe you're not proud.

     get south of the Wall

            (GASPS)

285
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:49,553
      Theon?

286
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:02,199
         You shouldn't be here.

287
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:26,256
         You smell particularly
         ripe this evening.

288
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:30,594
             Pour me some wine.

289
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:57,171
          Do you have
          something to tell me?

290
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:00,007
 No, my lord.

291
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,441
                    Reek.

292
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:07,981
        She saw me.

293
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,349
                           Who?

294
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:11,852
 Sansa. Lady Sansa.

295
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:13,453
 She came to the kennels.

296
00:26:15,057 --> 00:26:16,289
                   She saw you?

297
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:18,925
 Yes. I'm sorry, master.

298
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,244
 Forgive me.
 I didn't think...

299
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,344
                     Come here.

300
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:33,940
         You mustn't keep
         secrets from me, Reek.

301
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,175
             Get on your knees.

302
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,739
             Give me your hand.

303
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:13,597
                 I forgive you.

304
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,444
       BOLTON: I trust you find
       your chamber suitable,
       my lady?

305
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,380
                Yes, thank you.

306
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:31,614
        Allow me.

307
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:36,920
            Mother.

308
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,540
 Thank you, Ramsay.

309
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:54,672
 My lady, we are all a family,
 we northerners.

310
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,091
       Our blood ties go
       back thousands of years.

311
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,128
     So, I'd like to
     drink to our wedding.

312
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:05,281
      May our happiness
      spread from Moat Cailin
      to the Last Hearth.

313
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,952
     To your wedding.
 To your wedding.

314
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,279
  It must be difficult for you,
  being in a strange place.

315
00:28:19,348 --> 00:28:22,148
    This isn't a strange place,
    this is my home.

316
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:24,000
               It's the people
               who are strange.

317
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,690
         You're right.

318
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,758
         Very strange.

319
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:36,596
       More wine, please.

320
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:45,938
 I heard you two
 had been reunited.

321
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:49,209
    A fitting place for it.

322
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:54,347
 I like to imagine that
 the last time you spoke

323
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:56,149
 was in this very room.

324
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:02,705
 Are you still angry
 with him after he...

325
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,446
          What he did?

326
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:11,798
 Don't worry.

327
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:13,850
      The North remembers.

328
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,520
 I punished him for it.

329
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,090
  He's not ironborn any more.

330
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,210
 Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

331
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:25,078
 He's a new man.

332
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:29,282
 A new person, anyway.

333
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,383
       Aren't you, Reek?

334
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,036
                   Yes, master.

335
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,371
 That's his new name, Reek.

336
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,107
        Why are you doing this?

337
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,178
 Because Reek has
 something to say to you.

338
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:43,847
 Don't you, Reek?

339
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,026
 An apology?

340
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:04,668
 Apologize to Lady Sansa
 for what you did.

341
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,206
 Apologize for murdering
 her two brothers.

342
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:16,480
                 I'm sorry.

343
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:19,983
 Look at her, Reek.

344
00:30:21,303 --> 00:30:23,369
 An apology
 doesn't mean anything

345
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:25,438
 if you're not looking
 the person in the eye.

346
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:33,379
                I'm sorry.

347
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:34,748
 RAMSAY: Sorry about what?

348
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,667
     For killing your brothers.

349
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:51,864
 There, over and done with.

350
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,366
 Doesn't everyone
 feel better?
 I do.

351
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,768
                (SNIFFLING)

352
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:57,638
  That was getting very tense.

353
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,856
 Whew.

354
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,095
 You know what, my lady?

355
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:09,249
 What with him having
 murdered your brothers

356
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:11,451
       and the rest of
       your family gone,

357
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:18,041
 Reek here is the nearest
 thing to living kin

358
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,009
 that you have left.

359
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:21,727
 Reek.

360
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:24,965
 You will give away the bride.

361
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:31,537
 Someone has to.
 What better person?

362
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:32,905
       Good?
       Good?

363
00:31:34,076 --> 00:31:36,626
 Yes, yes, very good.

364
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:37,995
           Wonderful.

365
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:43,684
 Walda and I have
 some good news as well,
 since we're all together.

366
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,408
    We're going to have a baby.

367
00:31:58,133 --> 00:31:59,799
 I'm very happy for you.

368
00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:04,254
 From the way she's carrying,
 Maester Wolkan says
 it looks like a boy.

369
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,555
 RAMSAY: How can you be sure?

370
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,873
 Sure of what?

371
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,274
           That she's pregnant.

372
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,877
                      I mean...

373
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,796
              How can you tell?

374
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,298
       Maester Wolkan
       has assured us
       beyond all doubt.

375
00:32:41,143 --> 00:32:44,644
     So, how did you manage it?

376
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,279
 Manage what?

377
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:48,748
          Getting her pregnant.

378
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:50,816
  I imagine you're
  familiar with the procedure.

379
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:55,055
       Of course,
       but how did you find it?

380
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,990
 You disgraced
 yourself at dinner,

381
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,260
 parading that creature
 before the Stark girl.

382
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:01,744
             And if it's a boy?
 (CHUCKLES)

383
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,633
 You're worried
 about your position.

384
00:33:06,702 --> 00:33:08,735
    My position is quite clear.

385
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:11,872
                I'm your son

386
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,340
       until a better
       alternative comes along.

387
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,985
 You've never asked
 me about your mother.

388
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,042
              Why would I?

389
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:35,412
                She had me,
                she died.

390
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:38,131
        And here we are.

391
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:41,167
 BOLTON:
 She was a peasant girl.

392
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,437
 Pretty in a common
 sort of way.

393
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:46,906
 She was the miller's wife.

394
00:33:46,975 --> 00:33:50,477
 Apparently they had married
 without my knowledge
 or consent,

395
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:52,312
 so I had him hanged,

396
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,615
 and I took her
 beneath the tree
 where he was swaying.

397
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:57,451
 She fought me the whole time.

398
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,403
 She was lucky
 I didn't hang her, too.

399
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,438
 A year later
 she came to my gates

400
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,407
 with a squalling
 baby in her arms.

401
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,876
 A baby she claimed was mine.

402
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:08,578
 I nearly had her whipped,

403
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,596
 and the child
 thrown in the river.

404
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,171
 But then I looked at you,

405
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,556
 and I saw then what I see now.

406
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:22,659
 You are my son.

407
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:38,542
  Stannis Baratheon
  has an army at Castle Black,

408
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,510
  but he won't stay for long.

409
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,213
 He wants the Iron Throne,

410
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,667
 and the road to
 King's Landing comes
 right through Winterfell.

411
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,336
 He means to take the North.

412
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:55,492
 But the North is ours.

413
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,993
 It's yours and mine.

414
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,430
 Will you help me defeat him?

415
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:03,934
                 Yes.

416
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,661
 Is this every book there is?

417
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,663
           Every book there is?

418
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,033
         In the world.

419
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:21,935
                      Well, no.

420
00:35:22,004 --> 00:35:25,939
            There are thousands
            and thousands of
            books out there.

421
00:35:26,008 --> 00:35:27,607
        This library is
        rather small, actually.

422
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:29,676
 Where you grew up,
 were there more books?

423
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:32,328
         My father's not
         the most literate man.

424
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,668
          They say the Citadel
          has the largest
          library in the world.

425
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:39,903
      Where's that?

426
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:42,488
          The Citadel?

427
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:45,291
          In Oldtown.

428
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,066

        You can stitch a wound.

 I can wash the linens.
 I can sweep the floor.

   have the biggest library?

436
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:15,038
            It's where they
            train the maesters.

 killed a White Walker.

      hoping to find something,

463
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:42,758

 the Children of the Forest

464
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,494
              used to hunt

    returns with the wildlings,

476

      we could have
      thousands more men.

 with the wildlings.
 We can't wait that long.

     more men, more horses,
     all fed and rested.

479
00:38:42,136 --> 00:38:44,937
         But every day we wait,
         the odds shift in
         Bolton's favor.

                Yes, my queen.

568
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:47,670
    And in order to
    forge a lasting bond
    with the Meereenese people,

569
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:49,955
        I will marry the leader
        of an ancient family.

570
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,177
         Thankfully a suitor is
         already on his knees.

571
00:47:23,824 --> 00:47:25,624
                   Don't worry.

572
00:47:25,693 --> 00:47:28,727
 I'll be fine.
 Nothing broken,
 I don't think.

573
00:47:31,366 --> 00:47:33,082
              Where are we now?

574
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:35,184
 Not the Rhoyne.

575
00:47:41,075 --> 00:47:43,576
 Long, sullen silences

576
00:47:43,645 --> 00:47:46,545
     and an occasional
     punch in the face.

577
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:51,066
    The Mormont way.

578
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:56,888
   Let's start over.

579
00:47:58,259 --> 00:48:00,776
        I apologize for before.

580
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:03,929
             My mouth sometimes
             runs away from me.

581
00:48:03,998 --> 00:48:06,231
 This doesn't have to
 be an unpleasant trip.

582
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:14,723
   We're going to be spending
   a lot of time together
   on the way to Meereen.

583
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:15,775
            We are.

584
00:48:17,945 --> 00:48:20,846
   What would make
   our time together
   truly enjoyable

585
00:48:20,915 --> 00:48:22,280
   would be some wine.

586
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:24,650
            No wine.

587
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,973
 I am a person who drinks.

588
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:35,193
     People who drink
     need to keep drinking.

589
00:48:35,262 --> 00:48:36,896
      Otherwise, they're not...

590
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,205
      I know where we are.

591
00:48:46,274 --> 00:48:48,374
               You're taking us
               through Valyria.

592
00:48:48,976 --> 00:48:50,726
         I am.

593
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:52,228
      TYRION: Have you
      sailed this route before?

594
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,962
                  JORAH: No.

595
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,665
   You're going to
   bring Daenerys a souvenir

596
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:58,551
  from her ancestral homeland
  in case I'm not enough?

597
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,753
 I think you'll be plenty.

598
00:49:01,722 --> 00:49:04,256
        You know what they say.

599
00:49:04,324 --> 00:49:07,493
 The Doom still rules Valyria.

600
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:09,795
   What about
   the demons and the flames?

601
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:13,215
 Aren't you afraid of the Doom?

602
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,433
                  JORAH: No.

603
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:17,586
 But the pirates are.

604
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:19,255
               Oh.

605
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,660
       TYRION: The Smoking Sea.

606
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,280
             How many centuries
             before we learn

607
00:49:28,348 --> 00:49:30,282
    how to build
    cities like this again?

608
00:49:31,485 --> 00:49:34,185
    For thousands of years,
    the Valyrians were

609
00:49:34,254 --> 00:49:37,340
     the best in the world
     at almost everything.

610
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,175
              And then...

611
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:41,810
 And then they weren't.

612
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,579
         And then they weren't.

613
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:49,701
  "They held each other close

614

    shot so high and hot
    That even dragons burned

624
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:28,457
               I would clap.

625
00:50:34,749 --> 00:50:36,766
  I suppose this is it, then.

626

 the coast. With luck,
 we'll find a fishing village.

658
00:54:12,566 --> 00:54:14,166
 Maybe another boat.

                  Without luck?

 We've got a long
 walk ahead of us.
