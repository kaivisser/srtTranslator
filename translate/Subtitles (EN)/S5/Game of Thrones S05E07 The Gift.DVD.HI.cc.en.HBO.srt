 Those aren't just
 the Stark words. It's a fact.

166

 If we march back
 to Castle Black,
 we winter at Castle Black.

 this winter will last?

 we've lost.

 We march to victory,
 or we march to defeat,

172

 Only forward.

 walk along
 the battlements of Winterfell.

184

     the flayed man banners
     lowered to the ground.

              strange for you.

404
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:43,066
           Everyone you meet
           has a hidden motive,

405
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,568
   and you pride
   yourself on sniffing it out.

406
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,105
            But I'm telling
            you a simple truth.

407
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:50,873
              I serve the gods.

408
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,076
       The gods demand justice.

409
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,845
 How do they
 communicate their demands?

410
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,146
 By raven or horse?

411
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,466
        By the holy text,
        The Seven-Pointed Star.

412
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:03,987
          If you don't have
          one in your library,
          I'll give you my own.

413
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:06,556
 I've read
 The Seven-Pointed Star.

414
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,792
          Then you'll
          remember the passages

415
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,260
           concerning
           buggery and perjury.

416
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,262
 Your
 grandchildren will be punished

417
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:18,001
        in the same manner
        as anyone who
        breaks the sacred laws.

418
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,470
 Half the men,
 women, and children

419
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,189
 in this foul city
 break the sacred laws.

420
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:26,325
 You live among murderers,
 thieves, and rapists,

421
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:31,781
 and yet you punish Loras
 for shagging

               have any concern
               for my house,

573

       my grandchildren, or me.

574

    you'd return to the capital

575

           as soon as things
           started to go wrong.

576
00:43:14,743 --> 00:43:15,842
 I promise you...

577
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,309
   I promise you, Lord Baelish,

578

   I will have nothing to hide.

        with some accident here

582
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:32,541

            a part in all this?

586
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,903
 Cersei summoned me
 to King's Landing.

587
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:45,304
 I dared not refuse her.

588
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,039
         And what did she want?

589
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:50,209
 A piece of information
 she knew that I had.

590
00:43:50,277 --> 00:43:53,195
 Neither silence nor
 lies were an option.

591
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,631
 But I have other information

592
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,934
 of which she is unaware.

593
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:02,254
 And as you say,
 our interests are aligned.

594
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,808
 I have a gift for you.

595
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:08,043
             What kind of gift?

596
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,779
 The same kind I gave Cersei.

597
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:12,981
  A handsome young man.

602
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:38,791
             it will represent
             a significant rise
             in your station.

603
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,627
        But if you do
        happen to triumph here,

604
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:45,965
    you will fight at the Great
    Pit of Daznak itself,
    in front of the queen.

605
00:44:46,034 --> 00:44:50,603

                   You saw her?
           Yes.

697
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:48,146
       And?

698
00:52:48,216 --> 00:52:49,297
             Her accommodations
             seem sufficient.

699
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,867
       What happens to her now?

700
00:52:51,936 --> 00:52:56,105
 Well, she and her
 brother are both being held
 under fair suspicion.

701
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,790
 A trial will be
 held for each of them

702
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:01,426
 to determine if
 they're guilty of any acts

703
00:53:01,495 --> 00:53:05,447
 that might constitute
 a violation of
 the tenets of the faith.

704
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,081
          Who will stand judge?

705
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:11,353
 Seven septons,
 as it was in all trials
 before the Targaryens.

706
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:13,889
       Will you be one of them?

707
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,957
    I will.

708
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:22,397
 If one or both of them were to
 confess before the trial...

709
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:24,199
 Then they will be
 shown the Mother's mercy.

710
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:27,469
     And what does
     the Mother's mercy entail?

711
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,823
 It depends upon the situation.

712
00:53:30,891 --> 00:53:33,726
 The acts themselves,
 the degree of contrition.

713
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:36,612
        Thank you, High Septon,

714
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,164
  for bringing them
  whatever justice they deserve

715
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:41,850
      in the eyes of the Seven.

716
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:49,224
 Did you know this chapel is
 one of the oldest structures

717
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,425
 in King's Landing?

718
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,663
            I think I may have
            heard at one point.

719
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,765
               Baelor built his
               sept around it.

720
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:01,236
 But men worshipped
 here long before him.

721
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,973
     Who carved this altar?

722
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,958
      Do you know?
            I'm afraid I don't.

723
00:54:08,395 --> 00:54:10,562
 No one does.

724
00:54:10,631 --> 00:54:14,016
 There's no name on it,
 or anywhere
 else in the chapel.

725
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,737
 No, the people
 who built this place

726
00:54:18,806 --> 00:54:22,875
 didn't inflict their vanity
 on those who came after them,

727
00:54:22,943 --> 00:54:26,895
 the way Baelor did
 with that great gilded
 monstrosity up there.

728
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,463
                      Hmm.

729
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:30,131
 Their faith was clean.

730
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:35,254
 Strip away the gold
 and the ornaments,

731
00:54:35,322 --> 00:54:37,556
 knock down
 the statues and the pillars,

732
00:54:38,626 --> 00:54:40,125
 and this is what remains.

733
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:45,614
 Something simple,

734
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:52,588
 solid, and true.

735
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,379
 The Tyrells' finery
 will be stripped away.

736
00:55:01,448 --> 00:55:06,051
 Their lies knocked down.
 Their true hearts
 laid bare for all to see.

737
00:55:07,988 --> 00:55:09,788
    And so it will
    be for all of us.

738
00:55:10,757 --> 00:55:12,824
      High and low alike.

739
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,782
       What will we find

740
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,200
      when we strip
      away your finery?

741
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:28,490
 A young man came
 to us not long ago,

742
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,660
 broken in body and spirit.

743
00:55:34,265 --> 00:55:36,431
 He had so much to strip away.

744
00:55:38,452 --> 00:55:40,218
 So much weighing him down.

745
00:55:42,122 --> 00:55:45,223
 But piece by piece,
 he unburdened himself.

746
00:55:46,694 --> 00:55:48,226
 Let go of vanity,

747
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,995
     pride, sin.

748
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,368
 Now his soul is so light,

749
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:59,638
 he will float through
 the seven heavens like a bird.

750
00:56:00,006 --> 00:56:01,005
                    Hmm.

751
00:56:06,546 --> 00:56:09,330
 And he has much
 to say about you.

752
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:10,465
          (DOOR OPENS)

753
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,135
         (DOOR CLOSES)

754
00:56:32,906 --> 00:56:33,905
               Move.

755
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:40,261
     Let me go immediately.

756
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,698
     You will order
     her to let me go.

757
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:45,283
          I am the queen!

758
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:47,435
    Have you lost your mind?

759
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:48,503
           Let me go!

760
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:54,008
   ...your filthy hands off me!
   Are you out of your mind?

761
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,412
     I am the queen! Let me go!

762
00:57:03,971 --> 00:57:05,303
       Look at me.

763
00:57:08,108 --> 00:57:09,541
     Look at my face.

764
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:15,097
   It's the last thing
   you'll see before you die.
