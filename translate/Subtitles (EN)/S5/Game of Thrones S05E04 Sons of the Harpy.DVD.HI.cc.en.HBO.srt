59
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,898
          Well, House Tyrell
          could front the gold,

60
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,167
           and the crown would
           pay us back in time,

61
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,253
              or I'd have words
              with my daughter.

 given us too much.

63

   No,
   we must arrange better terms
   with the Iron Bank.

64
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,300
              Absolutely.
                     In person.

65
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,020
                      Me?

66

  would have asked the vintage.

82

 I could say that our minds
 are temples to the Seven,

83
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,529
 and should be kept pure.

84

 I don't like the taste.

         piled in the streets.

90
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:06,584
  Wars teach people
  to obey the sword,
  not the gods.

91
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,903
          Perhaps the gods need
          a sword of their own.

92
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,623
         In the days
         before the Targaryens,

93

   the Faith Militant dispensed
   the justice of the Seven.

 Militant was disarmed

           their holy purpose
           to my son, the king,

96
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,353
             I have no doubt he
             will sign a decree

          the gods themselves.

100

         And to you, of course,

101

   as the chosen
   representative of the Seven.

102

104

  Which is why you were chosen.

105
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,295

00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,884
        There's a special place
        in the seventh
        hell for your kind.

137
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:57,155
 MAN: Please. Please, I'll pay.

138
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,506
           I'll pay all of you.

139
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:00,525
                 Yes, you will.

140
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:05,647
         (MAN SCREAMS)

141

142

              (GRUNTING)

143
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,778
           Seize him.

144
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,647
            Sinner.
           (GRUNTING)

145
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:41,382
 LORAS: Get your hands off me.

146
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,152
 Ser Loras of House Tyrell,
 you have broken
 the laws of gods and men.

147
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,004
      Who do you think you are?

148
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:49,457
         Justice.

149
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,883
 Why is my brother in a cell?

150
00:11:58,952 --> 00:11:59,934
                 I don't know.

151
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:03,171
             I didn't order it.

152
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,405
 We both know who did.

153
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:09,978
 You told me
 she was returning
 to Casterly Rock.

154
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:11,912
          Are you saying my
          mother's behind this?

155
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,298
   She's jealous
   you're not hers anymore.

156
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,368
 Arresting my
 brother is her revenge.

157
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,620
          Aren't you and
          Mother getting along?

158
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:20,821
         (HUFFS)

159
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:29,029
      Oh, my sweet, sweet king.

160
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,835
       Do you have any
       affection for me at all?

161
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:36,704
        Of course I do.

162
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,206
        You're my queen.

163
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,809
            I can't bear to
            think of my brother

164
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:44,311
               locked away in
               some grimy cell.

165
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,783
 I'll set him free for you.

166
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,218
                Do you promise?

167
00:12:57,426 --> 00:13:00,161
            I demand that Ser
            Loras be freed now.

168
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,429
 Did I arrest him?

169
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,550
                     Well, no.

170
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,002
            But you armed
            the Faith Militant.

171
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:11,088
              You gave the High
              Sparrow an army.

172
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,356
         I did.

173
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,994
 And your wife has
 every right to criticize.

174
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:20,581
 We can't allow fanatics
 to arrest the queen's brother,

175
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,483
   no matter his perversions.

176
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:24,786
            Then,

177
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,290
         can I tell Margaery
         you'll have Ser
         Loras released?

178
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:31,859
 I told you,
 I'm not holding Ser Loras.

179
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,362
 You're the king.

180
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,999
 I'm sure if you speak
 to the High Sparrow,
 he'll release the poor boy.

181
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,455
             Halt!

182
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:10,814
 His Holiness is praying.
 He will not be disturbed.

183
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:15,152
   Give the order, and
   we'll clear out this rabble.

184
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:19,506
            You mean kill them?

185
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,093
             Here, at the sept?

186
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,044
          You'd be sending them
          to meet the gods
          that they love.

187
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:30,168
        MAN 1: Bastard!

188
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,319
 MAN 2: You're an abomination!

189
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,527
      MAN 3: Born of sin!

190
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,862
     WOMAN: Filthy bastard!

191
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,552
    We'll find another way.

192
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,623
      MAN 4: Abomination!

193
00:14:58,698 --> 00:14:59,963
         My queen?

194
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,821
 There was no way
 to free Ser Loras
 without violence.

195
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,978
 You're the King of the Andals,

196
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,681
 the Lord of
 the Seven Kingdoms,
 the Protector of the Realm,

197
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,884
 and you let a band of fanatics
 imprison your brother-by-law.

198
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,071
         I'm going to speak
         with the High Sparrow.

199
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,923
    Are you? When?

200
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:29,143
                 I don't know.
 You don't know?

201
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,563
       He was praying just now.

202
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:37,385
      I have to send
      word to Grandmother.

203
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,238
 Will you come back later?

204
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:45,043
   I need to be with my family,
   Your Grace.

205
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,112
     Of course.

206
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,098
            (GRUNTING)

207
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,866
  SELYSE:
  You think highly of this boy?

208
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,585
                     Good.

209
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,153
 STANNIS: Lord Commander
 of the Night's Watch.

210
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,173
              And a bastard by
              some tavern slut.

211
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,009
        Perhaps, but that
        wasn't Ned Stark's way.

212
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,881
 I should have given you a son.

213
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,368
                Not your fault.

214
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:13,554
             Whose, then?

215
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:15,956
           I gave you
           nothing but weakness

216
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:20,144
                 and deformity.

217
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,331
     Those scars mean nothing
     to the Lord of Light.

218
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,517
            My lady.

219
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,086
 Her father is
 the Lord's chosen king,

220
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,639
 and her father's blood
 runs through her veins.

221
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,200
  You march on Winterfell soon?

222
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:47,688
 We must to beat the snows.

223
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:52,260
        Once before, you put
        your faith in Ser Davos
        and left me behind.

224
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,847
       I hope you won't
       make that mistake again.

225
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,116
    I won't.

226
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:02,770
      I need you.

227
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:05,205
  You only need faith, my king.

228
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:11,612
 And you. What do you need?

229
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,366
              To serve my Lord.

       (GRUNTING)

                  Lord Ashford.

232
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,580
             Lady Caulfield.

233
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:34,535
               Lord Smallwood.

234
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:36,070
     I've never even
     heard of these people.

235
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,606
          They haven't
          heard of you, either.

236
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:41,008
            But we need men,
            and they have some.

237
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:46,513
 How many men does
 this Lord Mayzen
 have to send us?

238
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,849
      More than Lord Wibberley.

239
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,413
                 Not him.

240
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,514
             I know. I'm sorry.

241
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,884
  But we need men and supplies,

242
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,436
       and Roose Bolton's
       the Warden of the North.

243
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,704
        He murdered my brother.

244
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:13,157
      We swore to be
      the watchers on the Wall.

245
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,861
          We can't watch
          the Wall with 50 men.

246
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,581
       And we can't get more
       men without help from
       the Warden of the North.

247
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:45,706
            Apologies, my lady.

248
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:55,683
         (DOOR CLOSES)

249
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,403
  Lord Commander.

250
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,206
            How can I help you?

251
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,375
 Come with us
 when we ride south.

252
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:07,394
 None of us know
 the castle as well as you do.

253
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:11,032
 Its hidden tunnels,
 its weaknesses, its people.

254
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:14,802
 Winterfell was your home once.

255
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:18,773
 Don't you want to
 chase the rats out of it?

256
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,378
   Castle Black is my home now.

257
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:27,548
         The Night's Watch take
         no part in the wars of
         the Seven Kingdoms.

258
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:29,050
          There's only one war.

259
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:31,652
            Life against death.

260
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:36,990
      Come, let me show you
      what you're fighting for.

261
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,993
       You're gonna show me
       some vision in the fire?

262
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:43,397
      Forgive me.
      I don't trust in visions.

263
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,067
 No visions. No magic.

264
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:49,770
  Just life.

265
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,410
 Do you feel my heart beating?

266
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,415
    There's power in you.

267
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,918
 You resist it,
 and that's your mistake.
 Embrace it.

268
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,849
       The Lord of Light
       made us male and female.

269
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:38,051
 Two parts of a greater whole.

270
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:41,706
 In our joining, there's power.

271
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,642
 Power to make life,

272
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,245
 power to make light,

273
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,082
 and power to cast shadows.

274
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,050
     I don't think Stannis
     would like that very much.

275
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,520
 Then we shouldn't tell him.

276
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,589
                  I can't.

277
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,757
         Why?

278
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,676
                 I swore a vow.

279
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,898
               I loved another.

280
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,267
 The dead don't need lovers.

281
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,318
        Only the living.

282
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,275
                      I know.

283
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,412
          But I still love her.

284
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,579
 You know nothing, Jon Snow.

285
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,727
        (KNOCK ON DOOR)

286
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:17,451
                Are you lonely?

287
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:20,537
          Just bored.

288
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,306
    My father used to
    tell me that boredom

289
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,391
     indicates a lack
     of inner resources.

290
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,027
 Were you bored a lot, too?

291
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,897
 I know Castle Black
 is no place for a child,
 but...

292
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:33,550
 I like it. I thought
 I'd be left at home.

293
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,418
 I know Mother
 didn't want to bring me.

294
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:37,721
           Why do you say that?

295
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,709
 She told me,
 "I don't want to bring you."

296
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,296
  She shouldn't have said that.

297
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:57,257
 Are you ashamed of me, Father?

298
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,137
       When you were an infant,

299
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,991
      a Dornish trader
      landed on Dragonstone.

300
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,295
    His goods were junk
    except for one wooden doll.

301
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,100
 He had even sewn a dress on it
 in the colors of our house.

302
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,938
            No doubt he'd
            heard of your birth

303
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,808
     and assumed new
     fathers were easy targets.

304
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,695
        I still
        remember how you smiled

305
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,330
           when I put that
           doll in your cradle.

306
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,784
              How you pressed
              it to your cheek.

307
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,611
     By the time we burned
     the doll, it was too late.

308
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:55,616
 I was told you would die.

309
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,801
                   Or worse,

310
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:01,488
   the greyscale would go slow.

311
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:03,790
       Let you grow just
       enough to know the world

312
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,026
              before taking
              it away from you.

313
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:08,712
        Everyone
        advised me to send you
        to the ruins of Valyria

314
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,948
       to live out your short
       life with the stone men,

315
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,834
     before the sickness
     spread through the castle.

316
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,438
 I told them all to go to hell.

317
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:22,409
     I called in every maester
     on this side of the world.

318
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:25,562
    Every healer.
    Every apothecary.

319
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:31,268
 They stopped the disease
 and saved your life.

320
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:34,337
     Because you do not
     belong across the world
     with the bloody stone men.

321
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,408
   You are the Princess Shireen
   of House Baratheon.

322
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,013
       And you are my daughter.

323
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,681
        (WATER DRIPPING)

324
00:25:44,594 --> 00:25:45,792
 LITTLEFINGER:
 I thought I
 might find you here.

325
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,231
 Your Aunt Lyanna.

326
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,686
 Father never talked about her,

327
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:58,589
 but sometimes I'd
 find him down here
 lighting the candles.

328
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,859
 They say she was beautiful.

329
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,194
      I saw her once.

330
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,448
     I was a boy living
     with your mother's family.

331
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:10,451
  Lord Whent held
  a great tourney at Harrenhal.

332
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:13,320
            Everyone was there.

333
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:16,523
     The Mad King, your father,

334
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:18,208
              Robert Baratheon,

335
00:26:19,027 --> 00:26:20,327
      and Lyanna.

336
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:23,330
            She was already
            promised to Robert.

337
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:25,965
           You can imagine what
           it was like for me,

338
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:28,518
      a boy from nowhere
      with nothing to his name,

339
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:33,340
   watching these legendary men
   tilting at the lists.

340
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:38,078
         The last two riders
         were Barristan Selmy
         and Rhaegar Targaryen.

341
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:41,849
      When Rhaegar won,
      everyone cheered
      for their prince.

342
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,867
 I remember the girls laughing
 when he took off his helmet,

343
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,103
 and they saw that silver hair.

344
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,421
           How handsome he was.

345
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,391
           Until he rode
           right past his wife,

346
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,112
       Elia Martell,
       and all the smiles died.

347
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:58,699
          I've never seen so
          many people so quiet.

348
00:27:00,136 --> 00:27:01,902
         He rode past his wife,

349
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:07,307
        and he lay
        a crown of winter roses
        in Lyanna's lap.

350
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,876
                Blue as frost.

351
00:27:12,982 --> 00:27:14,915
           How many tens of
           thousands had to die

352
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:16,850
               because Rhaegar
               chose your aunt?

353
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,305
 Yes, he chose her.

354
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,808
 And then he
 kidnapped her and raped her.

355
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,968
                     Come.

356
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:37,637
 Let's speak somewhere
 the dead can't hear us.

357
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:44,111
 You're dressed for riding.

358
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,179
                    I am.

359
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:48,715
 Where are you going?

360
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:50,850
                King's Landing.

361
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,453
 King's Landing?

362
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:54,621
            Cersei sent for me.

363
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,391
         We mustn't let her
         sniff out any trouble.

364
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,093
 You can't leave me here.

365
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:01,261
          I know how hard it is
          to live with
          people you despise.

366
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,362
               Believe me.

367
00:28:03,232 --> 00:28:04,364
      But it won't be for long.

368
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,300
       How do you know?

369
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:11,738
     Stannis Baratheon
     garrisons at Castle Black.

370
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:13,673
              He'll march south
              to King's Landing

371
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:15,576
           before the winter
           snows block his way.

372
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:19,012
     But first,
     he has to take Winterfell.

373
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,247
 You don't know that.

374
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:22,282
                I do.

375
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:24,551
  Once he liberates these lands
  from the Boltons,

376
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,121
             he'll rally your
             father's bannermen
             to his cause.

377
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:31,725
     With the North behind him,
     Stannis can finally
     take the Iron Throne.

378
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,693
     You think he'll
     defeat the Boltons?

379
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,163
          He has a larger army.

380
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:38,865
             He's the finest
             military commander
             in Westeros.

381
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:42,752
      A betting man would
      put his money on Stannis.

382
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,222
            I am a betting man.

383
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,191
 And if you're right?

384
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,293
      Stannis takes Winterfell,

385
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:53,496
           he rescues you from
           the most despised
           family in the North.

386
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,065
             Grateful for
             your late father's

387
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,532
          courageous
          support of his claim,

388
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,035
        he names you
        Wardeness of the North.

389
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:01,471
         But I...

390
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,206
      I wouldn't...

391
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,674
 Wardeness of the North?

392
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,377
               You are the last
               surviving Stark.

393
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,479
                 He needs you.

394
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,382
 And what if you're wrong?
 What if Stannis
 never attacks Winterfell?

395
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:15,151
 Or he does,
 and the Boltons defeat him?

396
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,722
       Then you will take
       this Bolton boy, Ramsay,
       and make him yours.

397
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:20,924
 I don't know how to do that.

398
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,793
             Of course you do.

399
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,128
   He's already fallen for you.

400
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,763
 His father frightens me.

401
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,398
          He should.
          He's a dangerous man.

402
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:34,137
         But even
         the most dangerous men
         can be outmaneuvered.

403
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,473
           And you've
           learned to maneuver
           from the very best.

404
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,444
   I'll return before too long.

405
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,313
      You be strong without me.

406
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,224
       The North will be yours.

407
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,927
             Do you believe me?

408
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:03,100

     the north of Westeros
     down on his luck in Essos.

547
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,678
        Dragon epaulets,
        bear sigil breastplate.

548
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,465
          You're Jorah Mormont.

549
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,685
                 I have to ask.

550
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:15,004
         How exactly were
         you serving your queen

551
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,857
             in a whorehouse
             half a world away?

552
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:21,327
         Is it possible
         that you were running?

553
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:25,114
      Why would you be running?
      And why would she
      have sent you away?

554
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:27,166
                  Oh, wait.

555
00:41:28,603 --> 00:41:30,886
        You were spying on her,
        weren't you?

556
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:33,673
    It's all coming back to me.

557
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,708
            I was drunk through
            most of the Small
            Council meetings,

558
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:37,543
      but it's all coming back.

559
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:40,713
           You passed notes to
           Varys' little birds.

560
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,951
     She found out, didn't she?

561
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,354
      Found out and exiled you.

562
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,657
            Now you hope to
            win back her
            favor with a gift.

563
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:54,593
                  Risky scheme.

564
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,582
  One might even say desperate.

565
00:41:59,651 --> 00:42:02,852
       You think
       Daenerys will execute me
       and pardon you?

566
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,755
            I'd say the reverse
            is just as likely.

        (BIRD SCREECHES)

      Everyone looks happy
      enough from up here.

                     (LAUGHING)
       What?

570
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:36,719
     I was thinking about
     all the times your brother

571
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,504
         made me go with him
         down from the Red Keep

572
00:42:38,572 --> 00:42:40,239
             into the streets
             of King's Landing.

573
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,740
        Why?

574
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,158
              He liked to walk
              among the people.

575
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,793
      He liked to sing to them.

576
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,795
 He sang to them?

577
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:49,098
                           Yes.
      (LAUGHS)

578
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,818
            Rhaegar would pick
            a spot on the Hook,

579
00:42:51,886 --> 00:42:54,536
        or the Street of Seeds,
        and then he'd sing.

580
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:55,922
           Just like all
           the other minstrels.

581
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,390
 And what did you do?

582
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,509
 I made sure no one killed him.

583
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,345
     And I collected the money.

584
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,396
        What? He liked to see
        how much he could make.

585
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:05,465
    He was good?

586
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:06,482
              He was very good.

587
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:07,816
        Viserys never told you?

588
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:11,453
 He told me Rhaegar
 was good at killing people.

589
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,841
   Rhaegar never liked killing.
   He loved singing.

590
00:43:14,909 --> 00:43:16,709
 And what did you
 do with the money?

591
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:19,678
      Well, one time,
      he gave it to the next
      minstrel down the street.

592
00:43:19,747 --> 00:43:22,415
           One time, he gave it
           to an orphanage
           in Flea Bottom.

593
00:43:22,483 --> 00:43:26,169
         One time,
         we got horribly drunk.

 in the audience chamber.

597
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:35,594
 How many others are there?

598
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,763
     Fifty? 100?

599
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,566
 Will you be joining us?

600
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:44,370
 I think I can protect you
 from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

 I think I can protect me
 from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

602
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,060
 Go, Ser Barristan.
 Sing a song for me.

603
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,362
                    Your Grace.

604
00:43:58,353 --> 00:44:01,804
  All men must die,
  but not all can die in glory.

605
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:02,905
     Glory?

606
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,156
         Why else do men fight?

607
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:05,958
 Why did your
 ancestors cross the Narrow Sea

608
00:44:06,027 --> 00:44:07,810
            and conquer
            the Seven Kingdoms?

609
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,346
  So their names would live on.

610
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:13,232
   Those who find
   victory in the fighting pits
   will never become kings,

611
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:15,384
  but their names will live on.

612
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:17,270
      It's the best
      chance they'll ever have.

613
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:19,204
        Is that what you
        used to tell men

614
00:44:19,273 --> 00:44:21,774
   before you set them
   to butchering
   each other for sport?

615
00:44:21,843 --> 00:44:24,693
 Today is the traditional start
 of the fighting season.

 recognize this tradition.

  that will hold this city,
