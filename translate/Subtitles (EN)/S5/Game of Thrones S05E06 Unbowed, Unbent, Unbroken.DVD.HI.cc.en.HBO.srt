136

137
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,071
    JAQEN: Is a girl ready?

138
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,575
     To give up her ears,
     her nose, her tongue?

139
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,047
          Her hopes and dreams,
          her loves and hates?

140
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,883
             All that makes
             a girl who she is?

141
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,886
                       Forever?

142
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:33,991
                   No.

143
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,928
            A girl is not ready
            to become no one.

144
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,070
           But she is ready to
           become someone else.

145
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:02,769
 Why Daenerys?
 Why is she worth
 all this?

146
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:06,173
 As I recall,

147
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:09,626
 the Mormonts fought
 against the Targaryens
 during Robert's Rebellion.

148
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,695
                 Do you believe
                 in anything?

149
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,030
 I believe
 in lots of things.

150
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,066
        In something greater
        than ourselves, I mean.

151
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,985
             The gods, destiny.

152
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:20,637
         Do you believe there's
         a plan for this world?

153
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:22,990
           No.

154
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,057
                 Neither did I.

155
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,927
                 I was a cynic,
                 just like you.

156
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:31,632
         Then I saw a girl
         step into a great fire
         with three stone eggs.

157
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:35,035
      When the fire burned out,
      I thought I'd find
      her blackened bones.

158
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:38,840
            Instead, I saw her,
            Daenerys,

159
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:42,877
      alive and unhurt,
      holding her baby dragons.

160
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:47,914
          Have you ever heard
          baby dragons singing?

161
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:49,984
        No.

162
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:51,986
            It's hard to be
            a cynic after that.

163
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:56,290
 Doesn't mean she's going
 to be a great queen.

164
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,425
                No, it doesn't.

165
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,877
      The Targaryens
      are famously insane.

166
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,580
 What if she conquers
 the world? Then what?

167
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,050
 A thousand years of
 peace and prosperity?

168
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,252
             First we have to
             conquer the world.

169
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,686
    We?

170
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,373
 All right, let's assume
 your dreams come true.

171
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:15,509
 She's ecstatic
 when you bring her
 this enemy dwarf.

172
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:18,579
 She hacks off my head
 and restores your position.

173
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:22,366
 You command her army,
 sail to Westeros,
 defeat all your enemies,

174
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,303
 and watch her
 climb those steps
 and sit on the Iron Throne.

175
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,105
 Hurrah. Long live the queen.
 Then what?

176
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,891
 Then she rules.

177
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:33,160
 So, a woman who has not
 spent a single day of her
 adult life in Westeros

178
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:35,580
 becomes the ruler
 of Westeros?
 That's justice?

179
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:36,848

       She's the rightful heir.

180
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,616
           Why?

181
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:41,752
 Because her father, who burned
 living men for amusement,
 was the king?

182
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:46,207
 That's a slave ship.

 came ashore for...

00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,366

 And how could he know
 unless he sees the dwarf?

205
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,621
            It will be

          tolerate this insult.

266
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:29,523
 House Tyrell
 won't tolerate it?

267
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:31,692
 I'm the insulted party,
 Lord Baelish.

268
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:35,328
 Ser Loras was promised to me.
 Instead, he chose
 the company of boys.

269
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:37,664
      One's choice of companion
      is a curious thing.

270
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,986
         Most curious.

271
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:46,773
 Lysa Arryn, for instance.

272
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,409
 A thoroughly repellant woman.

273
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,745
 Forgive me.

274
00:23:51,814 --> 00:23:54,414
 I know you're
 still in mourning.

275
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:58,552
         Lysa was a good woman.
         A kind woman.

276
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:01,287
 She was neither
 of those things.
 We both know it.

277
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,707
 Still, I pity her son.

278
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,959
 How fortunate
 the young Lord
 of the Vale

279
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,195
 has a new father
 to counsel him.

280
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:10,531
      I know how hard it can be

281
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,950
      to lose both your parents
      at such a young age.

282
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:17,087
 If war comes to Westeros,
 will the Knights of the Vale
 fight for their king?

283
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:20,624
               Young Lord Robin
               heeds my advice,

284
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,777
    and I have always counseled
    loyalty to the throne.

285
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:25,212
          Good.

286
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:31,484
    If there's nothing else.

287
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:34,721
            There is another
            matter, Your Grace.

288
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,590
  Something so urgent
  I couldn't trust
  the words to a raven.

289
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:40,360
       You once charged me
       with finding Arya Stark.

290
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:42,329
   To my shame, I failed you.

291
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:45,365
 But I have found Sansa Stark.

292
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:50,820
 Alive and well and home again

293
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,322
     living at Winterfell.

294
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,374
 That's not possible.

295
00:24:54,443 --> 00:24:58,128
    My sources are well placed.

296
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:02,466
      They tell me Roose Bolton
      plans to marry her
      to his son, Ramsay,

297
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,202
           a bastard
           recently legitimized
           by King Tommen.

298
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,839
 Roose Bolton is
 Warden of the North
 by the grace of my father.

299
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:12,859
         Indeed, his reward
         for stabbing his
         own king in the heart.

300
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:16,763
 We were fools to
 trust a turncloak.

301
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,865
         Marrying his son to
         the last of the Starks

302
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,500
        gives him more
        legitimacy in the North

303
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,920
        than an alliance with
        a hated southern house.

304
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:25,839
                I will skin him
                and his bastard

305
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:28,142
            like that wretch on
            their bloody sigil.

306
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,877
      I would counsel patience,
      Your Grace.

307
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,862
       Patience?

308
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:34,731
 Sansa helped murder my son.
 Roose Bolton is a traitor.

309
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,733
             Stannis Baratheon
             is also a traitor,

310
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,052
            marching with his
            army on Winterfell.

311
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,622
              Let Stannis
              and Roose battle.

312
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:43,590
          Let the enemies
          of the throne
          slaughter each other.

313
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:47,343
      And when they're done,
      seize Winterfell from
      whichever thief survives.

314
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,929
 Winterfell is 1,000 miles
 away from here.

315
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:51,998
 The weather has
 already begun to turn.

316
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,518
     That is why it is critical
     to strike soon,

317
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,503
        while the victor
        still licks his wounds.

318
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:01,424
        Surely your Uncle Kevan
        could muster a force.

319
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,744
      My Uncle Kevan
      has all the courage
      of a kitchen mouse.

320
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,163
            Ser Jaime, then.

321
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,582
 Jaime's away
 on a sensitive
 diplomatic mission.

322
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,885
         I have no idea
         when he'll be back.

323
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:14,421
            Perhaps I can help.

324
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,857
        The Knights of the Vale
        are some of the best
        fighters in Westeros,

325
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:19,926
          trained to battle in
          the ice and the snow.

326
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,862
 Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

327
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:24,998
 you have a reputation
 as a moneylender

328
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:27,634
 and a brothel keeper,
 not a military man.

329
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:29,969
     You wouldn't risk
     a single Lannister soldier

330
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:32,205
       or a single coin
       from the royal treasury.

331
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,258
      What do you have to lose?

332
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:36,977
             A brothel keeper?

333
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:38,244
    And if you succeed?

334
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:40,397
   Name me Warden of the North.

335
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:47,287
     I'll speak to
     the king this evening,

336
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:50,724
 have him issue a royal decree.

337
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:53,643
   I'll not rest until the lion
   flies over Winterfell.

338
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,862
     I'll know you're
     a man of your word

339
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:58,765
 when I see Sansa Stark's
 head on a spike.

340
00:26:58,834 --> 00:26:59,916
                     As I said,

341
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:02,802
             I live to serve.

342
00:27:09,078 --> 00:27:11,477
 I'm going to ask him
 tomorrow.

343
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:15,082
            What if he says no?
    He won't.

344
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,484
 We've waited long enough.

345
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,819
   I want you to be my wife.

346
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,254
              Now.

347
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:24,307
          What is it?

348
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:27,644
        Do you want to marry me
        because our families
        arranged it?

349
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,012
                Or do you...

350
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,456
             We can't. Not yet.

351
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,657
        Why not?

352
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,909
              You know why not.
              Someone will see.

353
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:45,212
  You are going
  to be my wife.

354
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:49,466
 I am going to be
 your husband.

355
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:52,502
     We're allowed
     to walk through
     the gardens together.

           when you're jealous.

358

 answer the question.

               and many others.

533

534
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,243
 Is there anyone else
 who can support your claim?

535
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,913
                    Yes.

536
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,314
           Yes, Queen Margaery.

537
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,203
      She walked in on us once,
      not long ago.

538
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:25,938
     She didn't seem surprised.

00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:34,297
   take the word of a squire
   over the heir to Highgarden?

       a birthmark, Your Grace.

            and roughly
            the shape of Dorne.

    before the gods is as grave

       Lord Ramsay sent me to
       draw your bath, my lady.

566
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:57,896
         You want to be clean
         and fresh for your new
         husband, don't you?

 to end up like...

571

     Well, like the others.

572
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:33,633
                 What others?

573
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:35,851
      I shouldn't gossip.

574

00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,807
                What others?

577
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:46,696
 Let's see, there was Kyra,
 the blacksmith's daughter.

578
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:49,298
 She was tall like you,
 lovely figure.

579
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:53,769
       But she talked and
       talked and talked,

580
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:57,573
 and Ramsay
 grew tired of that.

581
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:59,442
 Then there was Violet.

582
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,128
 She had gorgeous blonde hair.

583
00:43:02,196 --> 00:43:05,131
     But she got pregnant.

584
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,016
 And, well, that was boring.

585
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,770
 Then Tansy.

586
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,639
 Such a sweet girl.

587
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:18,694
 Of course,
 sweet girls get a bit dull

588

   after a while, don't they?

589
00:43:20,982 --> 00:43:23,282
 Ramsay let me come
 with him on that hunt.

590
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,650
                  Hunt?

591
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:25,718
         Mmm.

592
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:31,841
 Have you ever seen a body
 after the dogs
 have been at it?

593
00:43:32,793 --> 00:43:34,593
 Not so pretty.

594
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:39,849
 But, well,
 it's your wedding day.

595

  Why am I talking
  about such things?

      What was your name again?

597

    Myranda.

598
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,862

      your bath, my lady?

          I'm to take your arm.
