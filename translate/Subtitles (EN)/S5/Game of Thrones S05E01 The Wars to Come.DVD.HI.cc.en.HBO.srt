 The Sons of the Harpy?

  BARRISTAN: Yes, Your Grace.
  They left it on the body.

141
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,179
 They've never
 killed before.

142

      It was only a matter
      of time, Your Grace.

00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:05,846
 He did not risk his life
 fighting for his freedom

147
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,848
 so cowards in masks
 could take it away.

148
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,950
       And I did not
       take up residence
       in this pyramid

149
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,987
      so I could
      watch the city below
      decline into chaos.

150
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,573

 their heads
 that much easier.

 If it wasn't heavy,
 it wouldn't stop a sword.

 Come. Try it again.

00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:47,091
   The gift of a great name.

275
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,611
     Sometimes
     that's all one needs.

276
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,946
 (GROANS LOUDLY)

277
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,502
        Good-bye, Lord Royce,
        and thank you for
        all you've done for me.

278
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,938
 I have done nothing more
 than my duty, my lady.

279
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,439
       I have no doubt
       that on my return,

280
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:05,109
       Robin's skills will have
       improved immeasurably.

281
00:24:05,795 --> 00:24:07,327
    He'll be safe here.

282
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:10,380
       As for his skills,

283
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,716
      I make no promises.

284
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:28,749
             Will we head north
             at some point?

285
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:32,252
     He said Sansa had
     a brother at Castle Black.

286
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,638
         We're a few days' ride
         from the King's Road.

287
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:35,873
       But that will take us...

288
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,040
      Us?

289
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:40,460
 The only reason
 you're here

290
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:43,047
 is because Jaime Lannister
 told me you weren't
 safe in the capital.

291
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,135
 You're hundreds of miles
 from King's Landing.

292
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:50,170
 No one knows
 what you look like.

293
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,240
 No one cares. You're safe.

294
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:54,340
           But I'm your squire.

295
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,093
             Do you even know
             what a squire is?

296
00:24:58,347 --> 00:24:59,479
      An attendant to a knight.

297
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:01,048
           I'm not a knight.

298
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:03,384
          That means
          you're not a squire.

299
00:25:03,452 --> 00:25:04,701
        Well, where would I go?

300
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,337
           I don't care.
           I'm not your mother.

301
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:18,232
              You swore to find
              the Stark girls.

302
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,834
     I found Arya. She
     didn't want my protection.

303
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:23,137
 Sansa still might.
      Will you shut your mouth?

304
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,289
 I didn't ask
 for your advice.

305
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,896
           I don't want
           anyone following me.
           I'm not a leader.

306
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:36,099
 All I ever wanted
 was to fight for
 a lord I believed in.

307
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:39,770
     The good lords are dead,
     and the rest are monsters.

308
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:42,172
       (HORSES NEIGHING)

309
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,848
 You told Lord Royce
 we were going
 to the Fingers.

310
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,250
                      I did.

311
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,686
 But we're heading west.

312
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,254
                        We are.

313
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,239
     If he wanted to betray us,
     he already would have.

314
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:04,511
 Lord Royce might
 be as honorable
 as he thinks he is,

315
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:06,814
 but he's not alone
 in that castle.

316
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:10,901
 Do you trust all
 those knights and ladies,
 stable boys and serving girls?

317
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,221
   No, do you trust
   the carriage driver
   or the knights escorting us?

318
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,056
    No. (CHUCKLES)

319
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:18,058
 But I pay them well,

320
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:20,460
 and they've seen what happens
 to men who disappoint me.

321
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:21,612
     So where are we going?

322
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,248
 To a land where
 you trust everyone?

323
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,985
              To a land
              so far from here,

324
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,921
    even Cersei Lannister
    can't get her hands on you.

325
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:42,148
 It was such a deep,
 deep shock to us all.

326
00:26:45,621 --> 00:26:47,487
      Your father was a...

327
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:50,357
   A force to be reckoned with.
   He truly was.

328
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,195
         I wouldn't presume
         to claim to have known
         him as such, but...

329
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:57,764
        But just being in
        his presence was enough

330
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,283
            to make it so clear
            just how formidable

331
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,002
             a person you
             were dealing with.

332
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:06,506
              What a force to
              be reckoned with.

333
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:10,277
 Thank you so much
 for your kind words.

334
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:17,317
           Deepest condolences,
           Your Grace.

335
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:21,554
         This tragedy...
         I never trusted Varys.
         I often warned...

336
00:27:26,362 --> 00:27:27,411
                Your Grace.

337
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:32,699
 Cousin Lancel.
 I hardly recognized you.

338
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:35,352
         My deepest sympathies.

339
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:38,222
           I apologize for my
           son's appearance.

340
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,672
 Uncle, that's
 quite all right.

341
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:45,412
 They call themselves Sparrows.

342
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:47,414
        Bloody fanatics.

343
00:27:47,483 --> 00:27:52,152
   Religion has its place,
   of course,
   but at a certain point...

344
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,088
          They never would have
          come to the capital
          when Tywin was alive.

345
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,408
 I'm sure he'll grow out
 of it, whatever it is.

346
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,278
     Excuse me.
                     Of course.

347
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:22,299
      Your wounds
      from the Blackwater
      seem to have healed.

348
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,536
 It wasn't my wounds
 that needed healing.

349
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:30,424
         What can I do for you?

350
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,793
      You can forgive me.

351
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:36,896
        What could you possibly
        have done to warrant
        my forgiveness?

352
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,165
 I led you into the darkness.

353
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,752
           I doubt you've ever
           led anyone anywhere.

354
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:44,604
 I tempted you into our...

355
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:46,072
 unnatural relations.

356
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:51,628
 And, of course,
 there was the king,

357
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,632
 his boar hunt.

358
00:28:57,252 --> 00:28:58,301
       His wine.

359
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:05,141
          I don't know what
          you're talking about.

360
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,277
 I'm a different person now.

361
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:12,032
 I've found peace in
 the light of the Seven.

362
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,333
 You can, too.

363
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:17,154
 They watch over all of us,
 ready to dole out mercy

364
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:18,905
      or justice.

365
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,762
 Their world is at hand.

366
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,082
 I will pray for
 your father's soul.

367
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,751
                   (LAUGHS)

368
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,556
         The day
         Tywin Lannister's soul
         needs your help...

369
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,098
 OLYVAR:
 It looks like Dorne.

370
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,433
             LORAS: It doesn't.

371
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:47,551
 (OLYVAR LAUGHS)

372
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,586
            It does.

373
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:54,624
 That's the Sunspear bit,
 right there.

374
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,393
     And that's where
     the mountains are.

375
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,563
      And over here is...

376
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,099
          Is Sunsnake?

377
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,200
          Stonespear?

378
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,902
                     Sandstone.

379
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,437
              Yes.

380
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,773
        Yes, Sandstone.

381
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,542
          Just there.

382
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,260
                      Fine.

383
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:18,698
                    It's Dorne.

384
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,452
 We should go there.

385
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:25,655
 I think we would
 have a lovely time,

386
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,791
 judging by my experience.

387
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,175
    That would be wonderful.

388
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,012
             Dorne, Highgarden.

389
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,780
             Anywhere but here.

390
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:44,424
               We're late for
               dinner as it is.

391
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:46,927
    You're very respectful.

392
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:48,795
               I'm very hungry.

393
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,397
              What's your name?

394
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,016
 Olyvar, my lady.

395
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:15,088
 I'm afraid my brother
 is keeping the king
 waiting, Olyvar.

396
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,916
                       My lady.

397
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:43,333
     Perhaps you might consider
     being a bit more discreet?

398
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,001
         Why?

399
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,304
   They all know
   about me anyway.

400
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,507
 Everybody knows
 everything about everyone.

401
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,609
 What's the point in trying
 to keep a secret
 in a place like this?

402
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,712
         In any event,
         you shouldn't keep
         your intended waiting.

403
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,515
 My intended? Please.

404
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,917
 Tywin's dead.

405
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,986
 That means no one can
 force Cersei to marry me.

406
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,955
                     Lucky you.
        Unlucky you.

407
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,207
    You think I want that woman
    married to my brother?

408
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:11,044
 If she doesn't marry me,
 she doesn't go to Highgarden.

409
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:13,429
 Which means she stays
 in King's Landing.

410
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,031
 Which means
 you're trapped here

411
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,600
 with Cersei Lannister
 as your mother by law.

412
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,668
                     Perhaps.

413
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:20,837
          Perhaps?

414
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:24,041
                       Perhaps.

415
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:41,591
      Eunuch, the spider,
      the Master of Whisperers.

416
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,960
         Imp, halfman.

417
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,231
     There are faster ways
     to kill yourself.

418
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,233
   Not for a coward.

419
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,337
        You are many things,
        my friend,
        but not a coward.

420
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,377
           You never told me
           why you set me free.

421
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,512
 Your brother asked me to.

422
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:04,981
            Could have said no.

423
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,384
 Refuse the Kingslayer?
 A dangerous proposition.

424
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,920
               Not as dangerous
               as releasing me.

425
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,322
     You risked your life,
     your position, everything.

426
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,358
        Why? You're not family.
        You owe me nothing.

427
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:17,760
 I didn't do it for you.

428
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,830
      I did it for
      the Seven Kingdoms.

429
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:23,200
 A drunken dwarf will
 never be the savior
 of the Seven Kingdoms.

430
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,302
 I don't believe in saviors.

431
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,788
 I believe men of talent
 have a part to play
 in the war to come.

432
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:33,326
       You're going to have
       to find another soldier.

433
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:36,829
        I'm done with Westeros,
        and Westeros
        is done with me.

434
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:41,701
  You have many
  admirable qualities,
  self-pity is not one of them.

435
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,405
 Any fool with a bit of luck
 can find himself
 born into power.

436
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:50,243
 But earning it for yourself,
 that takes work.

437
00:33:51,146 --> 00:33:52,579
  I'm not well-suited for work.

438
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:54,046
 I think you are.

439
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,783
 You have your father's
 instincts for politics,

440
00:33:56,852 --> 00:33:58,050
 and you have compassion.

441
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,386
               Compassion? Yes.

442
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:04,825
            I killed my lover
            with my bare hands.

443
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:07,978
           I shot my own father
           with a crossbow.

444
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,714
 I never said
 you were perfect.

445
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:13,817
              What is it
              you want exactly?

446
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,351
 Peace.

447
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,004
 Prosperity.

448
00:34:18,073 --> 00:34:21,174
 A land where the powerful
 do not prey on the powerless.

449
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:23,509
          Where the castles are
          made of gingerbread,

450
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:26,529
       and the moats are filled
       with blackberry wine.

451
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,631
       The powerful have always
       preyed on the powerless.

452
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:31,000
            That's how they
            became powerful
            in the first place.

453
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,936
      Perhaps.

454
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,605
 And perhaps we've grown
 so used to horror,

455
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:38,241
 we assume
 there's no other way.

456
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,745
 If you sat
 on the Iron Throne,

457
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,147
 would you spread misery
 throughout the land?

458
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,916
            I will never sit
            on the Iron Throne.

459
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:48,752
 No, you won't.

460
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,990
     But you could help another
     climb those steps
     and take that seat.

461
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,893
          The Seven Kingdoms
          need someone
          stronger than Tommen,

462
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,295
      but gentler than Stannis.

463
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,999
   A monarch who can intimidate
   the high lords and
   inspire the people.

464
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:07,971
 A ruler loved by millions
 with a powerful army
 and the right family name.

465
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,156
         Good luck finding him.

466
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:13,343
 Who said anything
 about "him"?

467
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:19,398
 You have a choice,
 my friend.

468
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:24,204
 You can stay here
 at Illyrio's palace
 and drink yourself to death,

469
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:27,807
 or you can ride
 with me to Meereen,
 meet Daenerys Targaryen,

470
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,393
 and decide if the world
 is worth fighting for.

471
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:36,833
    Can I drink myself to death
    on the road to Meereen?

472
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,079
 When did the Unsullied
 start patrolling
 the streets of Meereen?

473
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:53,150
        Looks like your friends
        haven't been
        behaving themselves.

474
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,005
      Our mission to Yunkai
      was a resounding success.

475
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,373
     The Wise Masters of Yunkai
     have agreed to cede power

476
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:03,610
         to a council of elders
         made up of both

477
00:36:03,678 --> 00:36:05,979
       the freed men and
       the former slaveholders.

478
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:09,115
     All matters of consequence
     will be brought
     to you for review.

479
00:36:09,183 --> 00:36:10,817
          Good.

480
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,435
              They did ask for
              some concessions.

481
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:14,954
    Concessions?

482
00:36:15,023 --> 00:36:17,123
        Politics is the art of
        compromise, Your Grace.

483
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:20,577
 I'm not a politician.
 I'm a queen.

484
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:23,296
    HIZDAHR: Forgive me.
    You're right, of course.

485
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:27,650
 Still, it's easier
 to rule happy subjects
 than angry ones.

486
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,952
 DAENERYS: I don't expect
 the Wise Masters to be happy.

487
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,172
        Slavery made them rich.
        I ended slavery.

488
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:36,109
         They do not ask for
         the return of slavery.

489
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:38,845
     They ask for the reopening
     of the fighting pits.

490
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:41,481
 DAENERYS: The fighting pits?

491
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,983
 Where slaves fought
 slaves to the death?

492
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:48,154
 In the new world that
 you've brought to us,
 free men would fight free men.

493
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:53,743
 The pit fighters you liberated
 plead for this opportunity.

494
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,645
            Bring some here and
            ask them yourself.

495
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,129
 No fighting pits.

496
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:59,299
             Opening them would
             show the people of
             Yunkai and Meereen

497
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,000
              that you respect
              their traditions.

498
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:04,120
 I do not respect
 the tradition of
 human cockfighting.

499
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:05,405
                    If you...

500
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,573
 How many times must I say no
 before you understand?

501
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:12,379
 Whatever he wants from me,
 he's not going to get it.

502
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:14,881
 If he really believes
 I'm going to reopen
 the fighting pits...

503
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:16,232
      DAARIO: You should
      reopen the fighting pits.

504
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:20,286
        What?

505
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:22,855
         My mother was a whore.
         I told you that.

506
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,293
             She liked to
             drink pear brandy.

507
00:37:27,362 --> 00:37:28,962
             The older she got,

508
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,965
     the less she made
     selling her body, the more
     she wanted to drink.

509
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:34,767
   So one day when I was 12,

510
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:38,003
 she sold me to a slaver
 she fucked the night before.

511
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,040
                  I'm sorry.

512
00:37:41,108 --> 00:37:43,977
 Why? I was a bad child.

513
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:47,646
 I wasn't big,
 but I was quick

514
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:48,948
 and I loved to fight.

515
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,984
 So they sold me
 to a man in Tolos

516
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:53,286
 who trained fighters
 for the pits.

517
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,989
 I had my first
 match when I was 16.

518
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:58,024
                  You were sold
                  into slavery,

519
00:37:58,093 --> 00:38:00,126
   forced to fight to the death
   for the amusement
   of the masters,

520
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,262
           and you're defending
           the fighting pits?
 (LAUGHS)

521
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:06,332
 I'm only here
 because of those pits.

522
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:08,701
 I learned to fight
 like a Dothraki screamer,

523
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:11,438
 a Norvoshi priest,
 a Westerosi knight.

524
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:12,838
 Soon I was famous.

525
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:14,907
 Ten thousand men
 and women screamed

526
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:16,909
 my name when I
 stepped into the pit.

527
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:21,381
 I made so much
 money for my master,
 he set me free when he died.

528
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,516
 I joined the Second Sons,

529
00:38:23,585 --> 00:38:25,234
 and then I met you.

530
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:33,192
 You're the queen.

531
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:35,928
 Everyone's too afraid
 of you to speak truth.

532
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:38,798
 Everyone but me.

533
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:42,401
 You've made
 thousands of enemies
 all across the world.

534
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,138
 As soon as they
 see weakness,

535
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:47,273
 they'll attack.

536
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:50,827
 Show your strength
 here, now.

537
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,195
        That's why I have
        the Unsullied
        patrolling the streets.

538
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,598
 (SCOFFS)

539
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:59,369
 Anyone with a chest
 full of gold can buy
 an army of Unsullied.

540
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,038
 You're not
 the Mother of Unsullied.

541
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,641
 You're the Mother of Dragons.

542
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:16,436
          I don't want
          another child's bones
          dropped at my feet.

543
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:19,422
               No one's seen
               Drogon in weeks.

544
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:22,108
             For all I know,
