 If both Stark girls

 maybe you're

 want your protection...

 advised against that.

00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,915
   TRYSTANE: My future queen.

288
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,753
             (SPEAKING SOFTLY)

289
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,693
            You are beautiful.

290
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:24,205
       The prince does not
       wish to be disturbed.

291
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:25,973
  Remove yourself from
  my path or I'll take

292
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:27,674
 that long axe and
 I'll shove it up your...

293
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:29,310
        DORAN: Captain.

294
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,947
         Let her pass.

295
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,786
     Your brother was murdered,

296
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:41,088
            and you sit here in
            the Water Gardens,

297
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,323
 staring at the sky
 and doing nothing.

298
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:47,612
 Oberyn was slain
 during a trial by combat.
 By law, that is not murder.

299
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,896
               Your brother.

300
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:50,764
 You don't have to remind me.

301
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,701
   He was my brother
   long before he
   was anything to you.

302
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,002
               What will you do
               about his death?

303
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,571
 I will bury him.
 I will mourn for him.

304
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,772
                     And then?

305
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,273
 You would have me go to war?

306
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,742
      The whole country
      would have you go to war.

307
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:04,611
 Then we are lucky
 the whole country
 does not decide.

308
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,999
   The Sand Snakes are with me.

309
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,667
      They have
      the love of their people.

310
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,604
             They will avenge
             their father while

311
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:16,423
           you sit here in your
           chair doing nothing.

312
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,713
             Oberyn is dead,

313
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,682
 and this Lannister girl
 skips about the Water Gardens,

314
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:29,953
             eating our food,
             breathing our air.

315
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,606
          How many of your
          brothers and sisters
          do they have to kill?

316
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,759
               Let me have her.

317
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,281
   Let me send her to
   Cersei one finger at a time.

318
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,135
    I loved my brother.

319
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,554
 And you made him very happy.

320
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:51,675
 For that, you will always
 have a place in my heart.

321
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:55,078
  But we do not
  mutilate little girls
  for vengeance.

322
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,715
     Not here.

323
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,132
      Not while I rule.

324
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,636
     And how long will that be?

325
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,405
 DAARIO: The Unsullied
 are too conspicuous.

326
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:24,274
 Anyone can see you
 coming from a mile off.

327
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,226
 Of course you haven't found
 any Sons of the Harpy.

328
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,762
         You haven't, have you?

329
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:30,448
          (GRUNTS)

330
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,551
       My Second Sons,
       on the other hand,

331
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:36,320
       they drink, whore,

332
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,222
     fight in the streets,

333
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,724
            they blend in.

334
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,159
       They overhear
       things in taverns,

335
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:45,929
  follow people to nice,
  quiet alleys,

336
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,031
 break a few fingers,

337
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,834
 overhear a few more things.

338
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,120
 Before you know it...

339
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:13,573
    No one here.

340
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,293
        We go.

341
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:19,130
     In a hurry? You're afraid?

342
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:21,164
   Unsullied fear nothing.

343
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,701
                      Right.

344
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,135
           That's your problem.

345
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,170
            You understood
            fear once long ago,

346
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,122
       but you've
       forgotten what it means.

347
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:31,525
 Someone who's forgotten fear

348
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:34,561
 has forgotten how to hide.

349
00:23:37,132 --> 00:23:38,331
         (MAN SCREAMS)

350
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:42,118
          (GROANS)

351
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,889
 Fear is useful that way.

352
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:55,732
                      (SCREAMS)

353
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,917
   Sons of the Harpy,
   they want to put
   a collar back on my neck.

354
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:17,071
  On all of our necks.
  Please, Your Grace,
  you must kill him.

355
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:18,956
       It would send a message.

356
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,175
 I think you should
 exercise restraint,
 Your Grace.

357
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:22,576
           Why?

358
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:24,161
 For one thing,
 he may have
 valuable information.

359
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,164
 The Son of the Harpy
 has no more
 valuable information.

360
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,415
    How do you know that?

361
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,784
      Because I questioned him.

362
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:33,070
  HIZDAHR: And
  the information you did get,
  he is young and poor.

363
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:34,521
               He is born free.

364
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,473
        Why should he want
        to bring back slavery?
        What did it do for him?

365
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,341
   Perhaps the only
   thing that gave him pride

366
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,877
       was knowing that
       there was someone
       lower than he was.

367
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,211
    They pay him.

368
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,447
   Great families
   afraid to do a thing.

369
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,914
            They pay poor men
            to do it for them.

370
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,850
      And how do you know this?
 Everyone know this.

371
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,952
             I don't know it,
             and I'm the head
             of a great family.

372
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,371
   BARRISTAN: We do not know
   what this man
   did or didn't do.

373
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,809
 Give him a trial at least.
 A fair trial.

374
00:24:55,878 --> 00:24:57,278
 Show all
 the citizens of Meereen

375
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:59,746
 that you're better than
 those who would depose you.

376
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:01,181
       Teach them a better way.

377
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,600
      I do not know the place
      from where Old Ser comes.

378
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,937
 Things maybe are
 different there, I hope.

379
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,039
 But here in Meereen,

380
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:12,042
 before Daenerys Stormborn,
 they own us.

381
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,411
 So we learn much about them,

382
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,613
 or we do not live long.

383
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,999
 They teach me what they are.

384
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:23,119
 Mercy, fair trial,
 these mean nothing to them.

385
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,439
 All they understand is blood.

386
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,729
          DAENERYS: Thank you
          all for your counsel.

387
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:43,773
     Your Grace,
     a word, please, I beg you.

388
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,125
          About what?

389
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:46,460
             About your father.

390
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:48,495
            About the Mad King.
    The Mad King?

391
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,263
    You're here to remind
    me of my enemies' lies?

392
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:51,464
 Consider me reminded.

393
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,433
          Your Grace,

394
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:56,003
    I served in his Kingsguard.

395
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,871
           I was at his
           side from the first.

396
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,073
      Your enemies did not lie.

397
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,209
         Go on.

398
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,847
         When the people rose
         in revolt against him,

399
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:11,435
      your father set their
      towns and castles aflame.

400
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:14,805
        He murdered sons in
        front of their fathers.

401
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:17,207
            He burned men
            alive with wildfire

402
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:18,958
  and laughed as they screamed.

403
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:23,630
             And his efforts to
             stamp out dissent

404
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:28,035
          led to rebellion
          that killed every
          Targaryen except two.

405
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,770
   I'm not my father.

406
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,308
                No, Your Grace.
                Thank the gods.

407
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:36,443
               But the Mad King
               gave his enemies

408
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,512
         the justice he
         thought they deserved.

409
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:42,382
            And each time,
            it made him feel
            powerful and right.

410
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:45,002
            Until the very end.

411
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:53,877
 I will not have
 the Son of the Harpy
 executed without a fair trial.

412
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:59,750
                    Your Grace.

          (BLEATING)

414
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,043
     There's a bug.

415
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:11,595
 Yes, best be careful.

416
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:14,464
 You might accidentally
 consume some solid food.

417
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,933
              When I agreed
              to come with you,

418
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,319
    did I
    misrepresent my intentions?

419
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,292
                      Besides,

420
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:28,495
       what else is
       there for me to do
       inside this fucking box?

421
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:29,613
  You don't like it?

422
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:30,714
         I want to take a walk.

423
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,416
 You can't.

424
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,452
 Cersei has offered a lordship
 to the man who
 brings her your head.

425
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:37,488
   She ought to offer her cunt.

426
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:40,540
           Best part of her for
           the best part of me.

427
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:44,511
          Well, I suppose a box
          is as good a place
          for me as anywhere.

428
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,213
 Are we really going to
 spend the entire
 road to Volantis

429
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:49,299
 talking about
 the futility of everything?

430
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,534
        You're right. No point.

431
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,553
          The road to Volantis?

432
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:56,523
            You said we were
            going to Meereen.
            What's in Volantis?

433
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,358
 The road to Meereen.

434
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,694
          And what do you hope
          to find at the end of
          the road to Meereen?

435
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,830
 I told you. A ruler.

436
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:06,066
     We've already got a ruler.

437
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:08,735
          Everywhere has
          already got a ruler.

438
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:10,937
         Every pile of shit on
         the side of every road

439
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:13,406
        has someone's
        banner hanging from it.

440
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:17,777
 You were quite good,
 you know, at ruling.

441
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:20,481
   During your
   brief tenure as Hand.

442
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:22,148
               I didn't rule.
               I was a servant.

443
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,534
 Still, a man of talent.

444
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,085
               Managed to kill
               a lot of people.

445
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:30,123
 Yes,
 but you showed great promise
 in other areas as well.

446
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,747
        She wanted me to
        leave King's Landing.

447
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,615
             She begged me.

448
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:39,833
             I wouldn't go.

449
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:41,467
        Why?

450
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,053
            'Cause I liked it.

451
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:45,756
                Power.

452
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,891
           Even as a servant.

453
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,844
 People follow leaders.

454
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:54,564
 And they will never follow us.
 They find us repulsive.

455
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:55,899
           I find us repulsive.

456
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,901
 And we find them repulsive,

457
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,305
 which is why we
 surround ourselves
 with large, comfortable boxes

458
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:02,506
 to keep them away.

459
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,509
        And yet,

460
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,744
 no matter what we do,

461
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:12,232
 people like you and me
 are never really
 satisfied inside the box.

462
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,901
 Not for long.

463
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:16,904
                You're right.

464
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:18,155
       Let's go for a walk.

465
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,555
        No.

466
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,592
           How many dwarves are
           there in the world?

467
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:25,328
              Is Cersei going
              to kill them all?

468
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,698
         (FLY BUZZING)

469
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:30,934
        Not him.

470
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,186
      Are you trying to
      deceive your queen?

471
00:29:33,255 --> 00:29:35,589
      Shall I throw them
      in a cell, Your Grace?

472
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:37,240
    That won't be necessary,
    Ser Meryn.

473
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,210
    I don't want to
    dissuade the other hunters.

474
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,778
     Mistakes will be made.

475
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:43,613
 Thank you, Your Grace.
         Thank you, Your Grace.

476
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,348
                 Take the head.
 Pardon me, Your Grace.

477
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,417
 I would take it,
 if you don't mind.

478
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,686
 It could prove
 useful for my work.

479
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:51,755
                     Very good.

480
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,261
       Over there will be fine.

481
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:00,547
 You heard the man. Over there.

482
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,199
         (DOOR CLOSES)

483
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:29,709
 You're the Hand of the King?

484
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:31,278
        No, Uncle.

485
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:33,212
    Clearly it would
    not be appropriate

486
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:35,047
      for a woman to
      assume that role.

487
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:37,183
 I'm merely advising my son
 until he comes of age

488
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,252
     and chooses
     a Hand for himself.

489
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:42,355
         Your Grace,
         I would be willing
         to serve provisionally

490
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,608
 as the King's Hand
 until he becomes old enough...

491
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,142
 You're a good man,
 Lord Tyrell,

492
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,244
 but I don't imagine
 you'll have the time.

493
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,547
 In addition to
 being Master of Ships,

494
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,299
 the king has
 appointed you Master of Coin.

495
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,219
        Oh, Your Grace.

496
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:57,703
   He called your
   experience and wisdom

497
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,140
   in financial
   matters unparalleled.

498
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,175
 He said he would be
 honored to have you

499
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:04,177
 represent the crown's
 interests in the same.

500
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,479
      The honor is all mine,
      Your Grace.

501
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:09,632
 Your Grace, in
 the past on several occasions,

502
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,269
   a grand maester has served
   as the King's Hand.

503
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:16,139
 The king has named Qyburn
 the new Master of Whisperers.

504
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:21,711
 Your Grace, him? This man?

505
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,015
  This
  embarrassment to the Citadel?

506
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,617
        Your Grace,
        what qualifications

507
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,103
        can he possibly
        have for this post?

508
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:32,773
 The qualification of loyalty,
 Grand Maester.

509
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:35,392
 That's far more than
 the eunuch ever had.

510
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,460
 Far more than many ever have.

511
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,330
   I must say, I cannot see...

512
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,566
 Uncle Kevan,
 in light of your position

513
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,734
 as commander of
 the Lannister armies,

514
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:48,338
 it would please the king
 if you would serve
 as his Master of War.

515
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,575
 No man living better
 deserves the title.

516
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:53,843
    That is kind of you to say.

517
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,212
        I would like to hear it
        from the king himself.

518
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,847
 The king is very
 busy at this moment.

519
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,083
              He should be here
              learning what
              it means to rule.

520
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:01,618
    He is learning.

521
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,987
 On this occasion,
 in his capacity as ruler,

522
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,406
 he's asked me to
 speak on his behalf.

523
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:10,142
        I returned to
        the capital to pay my
        respects to my brother.

524
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:13,246
         And to you.
         And to serve the king.

525
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:16,817
          I did not return to
          serve as your puppet.

526
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:21,254
             To watch you stack
             the Small Council
             with sycophants.

527
00:32:21,323 --> 00:32:22,873
  Sending your own brother away
  so he wouldn't be...

528
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,908
    My brother has
    left the capital to

529
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:26,910
   lead a sensitive
   diplomatic mission.

530
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,078
                  What mission?

531
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,797
 That is not your
 concern as Master of War.

532
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:35,001
       I do not
       recognize your authority

533
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:37,954
         to dictate what is
         and is not my concern.

534
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:41,140
      You are the Queen Mother,
      nothing more.

535
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:47,631
 You would abandon your king
 in his time of need?

536
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:51,100
    If he wants to send for me,
    I will be waiting for him.

537
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,036
              At Casterly Rock.

    SHIREEN:
    Come on, you know this one.

540
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:06,499
       It looks like an animal.

541
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:11,170
     Snake.

542
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,406
     Snake. S.

543
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:14,707
    It's an S.

544
00:33:14,777 --> 00:33:15,942
          Right, very good.

545
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:17,843
                           Huh!

546
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:21,047
 Did you know that the youngest
 Lord Commander in history,
 Osric Stark,

547
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:22,665
 was elected at the age of 10?

548
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,603
      I know S.

549
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,305
       You'll learn, I promise.

550
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,939
            I taught Ser Davos,
            and old people

551
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,474
           are terrible at
           learning new things.

552
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,676
 Well,
 you're a wonderful teacher.

553
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,496
 Very patient.

554
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:39,266
 I only said that the more time
 that you spend practicing,

555
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:40,566
              the faster you'll
              be able to read.

556
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:43,503
 That's all right.
 We're doing just fine.

557
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:48,491
 I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
 have a lot to talk about.

558
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,263
 How old were you
 when you learned how to read?

559
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:54,881
             Three.
                         Three?

560
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,017
  Who taught you, your mother?

561
00:33:57,085 --> 00:34:00,120
   No, old Maester Cressen did.

562

  inside because...

 What do you call
 it in the south,
 what happened to your face?

            north of the Wall?

 But two of my sisters had it.

569

 They both died.

           I was a baby.

         Lots of people came
         and tried, I think.

00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,448

             it went away.

 move out of the keep
 into the hut outside.

 None of us were
 allowed to go near them.

577

 especially at night.

580

583

       They acted like animals.

584
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:10,974
 My father had to drag them
 out to the woods on a rope.

585
00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:12,959

 Her name is Gilly. She's nice.
 I'm teaching her to read.

 Your father
 defeated her people.

 He executed their
 king for treason.

595

        him by striking at you.

 he led the mission to
 avenge Lord Commander Mormont.
