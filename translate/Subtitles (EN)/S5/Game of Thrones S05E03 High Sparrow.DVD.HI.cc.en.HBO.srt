 And Tywin Lannister is dead.

 Where are you taking me?

00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,645
             Home.

 You can't make me.
 He is a traitor. A murderer!

214
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,475
      No, you'll be marrying

00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:36,377

 you to do anything.

00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:20,474

             so he pardoned me,

261
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,296

00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,631
            I can't knight you,
            but I can teach
            you how to fight.

280
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,515
  I suppose that's
  more important.

281
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,214
          You weren't a knight,

282
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,050
      but you were a Kingsguard
      to Renly Baratheon,
      weren't you?

283
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,620
                   I was.

284
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,989
             Lord Tyrion said
             he was a good man.

285
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,492
          He was.

286
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,795
 How did you end
 up serving Renly?

287
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:14,188
         When I was a girl,
         my father held a ball.

288
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:17,925
     I'm his only living child,
     so he wanted to make
     a good match for me.

289
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:20,594
          He invited dozens of
          young lords to Tarth.

290
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,480
           I didn't want to go,
           but he dragged me
           to the ballroom.

291
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,619
          And it was wonderful.

292
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,425
     None of the boys noticed
     how mulish and tall I was.

293
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,662
         They shoved each other
         and threatened to duel

294
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,980
       when they thought it
       was their turn to dance.

295
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,417
       They whispered in my ear

296
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:47,137
         how they wanted to
         marry me and take me
         back to their castles.

297
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,510
        My father smiled at me,
        and I smiled at him.

298
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,279
     I had never been so happy.

299
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,852
           Till I saw a few of
           the boys sniggering.

300
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:05,372
              And then they all
              started to laugh.

301
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:08,475
     They couldn't keep
     the game going any longer.

302
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:11,545
      They were toying with me.

303
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:15,282
          "Brienne the Beauty,"
          they called me.
          Great joke.

304
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:20,487
        And I realized I was
        the ugliest girl alive.

305
00:22:21,457 --> 00:22:24,408
       A great lumbering beast.

306
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:33,584
           I tried to run away,
           but Renly Baratheon
           took me in his arms.

307
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,453
       "Don't let them see
       your tears," he told me.

308
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,355
   "They're nasty little shits,

309
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:42,626
     "and nasty little shits
     aren't worth crying over."

310
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,862
         He danced with me,
         and none of the other
         boys could say a word.

311
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,099
  Renly was
  the king's brother after all.

312
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,387
 But wasn't he...

313
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,224
 Lord Tyrion said he was...

314
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:01,112
        Yes, Pod, he liked men.
        I'm not an idiot.

315
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:03,880
             He didn't love me.
             He didn't want me.

316
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,816
           He danced with me
           because he was kind,

317
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,552
                and didn't want
                to see me hurt.

318
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,655
             He saved me
             from being a joke.

319
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:15,259
            From that day
            until his last day.

320
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,214
            And I couldn't
            save him in return.

321
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:27,388
      Nothing's more hateful
      than failing to
      protect the one you love.

322
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:32,226
             One day I will
             avenge King Renly.

323
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:34,562
 But you said
 a shadow murdered him.

324
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:36,913
 How do you fight a shadow?

325
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,266
         A shadow with the face
         of Stannis Baratheon.

326
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,605
         I know it was Stannis.
         I know it in my heart.

327
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:50,577
             Stannis is a man,
             not a shadow.

328
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:54,498
       And a man can be killed.

329
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,302
       Lord Commander.

330
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,420
                Your Grace.

331
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,371
       I'd like to speak alone.

332
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,707
        Olly is my steward now,

333
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,610
           as I was Lord
           Commander Mormont's.

334
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,578
          I want him to
          attend my meetings

335
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,514
              to learn from men
              with experience.

336
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,718
      One day he might command.

337
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,556
             Very well.

338
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,592
 Have you considered my offer?

339
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,327
                I have.

340
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,429
        And I thank you for it.
        You do me great honor.

341
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,100
        All my life I
        wanted to be Jon Stark.

342
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,602
 Say the word and you will be.

343
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,305
      But I have to refuse you.

344
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,626
          I'm Lord Commander
          of the Night's Watch.

345
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:41,094
          My place is here.

346
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:45,031
 I'm giving you the chance
 to avenge your family,

347
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:47,667
 to take back
 the castle where you grew up.

348
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,822
 To rule the North.

349
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,258
           I wish I could
           fight beside you.

350
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,210
            Believe me, I do.

351
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,613
           But I swore a sacred
           vow at the godswood.

352
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:02,583
          I pledged my life
          to the Night's Watch.

353
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,601
    You're as
    stubborn as your father.

354
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,387
       And as honorable.

355
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:08,855
             I can imagine
             no higher praise.

356
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,790
 I didn't mean it as praise.

357
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,426
 Honor got your father killed.

358
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:15,445
 But if your mind's made up,
 I won't try and dissuade you.

359
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,832
    May I ask how long you plan
    to stay at Castle Black?

360
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,935
 Are you bored of us already?

361
00:25:22,004 --> 00:25:25,956
     You saved us from
     Mance Rayder's army.
     We will never forget that.

362
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,758
        But it's
        a question of survival.

363
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,427
           The Night's
           Watch can't continue
           to feed your men

364
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:33,197
        and the wildling
        prisoners indefinitely.

365
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,349
              Winter is coming.

366
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,052
      I know it.

367
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:42,889
 We march on Winterfell
 within the fortnight,
 before the snows trap us here.

368
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:45,592
             And the wildlings?

369
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,645
 If they'd rather
 burn than fight for me,
 so be it.

370
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,130
 I leave their fate to you.

371
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:53,033
 You could execute them.
 That's the safest course.

372
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,122
 Or you could see if
 this Tormund fellow

373
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,858
 is more willing to compromise
 than Mance ever was.

374
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,610
 I assume the brothers
 of the Night's Watch

375
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:05,278
 would rather see
 the wildlings dead.

376
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:07,231
     Most of the brothers, yes.

377
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,951
        There's little love
        for the free folk here.

378
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,688
 You're the Lord Commander.
 Your decision.

379
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:15,989
          (DOOR OPENS)

380
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:17,891
    You have many
    enemies in Castle Black.

381
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,794
       Have you considered
       sending Alliser
       Thorne elsewhere?

382
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:24,798
     Give him command of
     Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

383
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:27,284
    I heard it was best
    to keep your enemies close.

384
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,620
 Whoever said that
 didn't have many enemies.

385
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:39,279
      DAVOS:
      He sees something in you.

386
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,868
        Might not be
        apparent from his tone,
        but it's the truth.

387
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,220
            He believes in you.

388
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:48,422
 I'm sorry I disappointed him.

389
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,879
 The king is a complicated man,

390
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,315
        but he wants to
        do what's right
        for the Seven Kingdoms.

391
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,716
 As long as he's ruling them.

392
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,286
        He's the one true king.

393
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,188
          He has a blood
          right to that throne.

394
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:07,925
 I've sworn to stay
 clear of the politics
 of the Seven Kingdoms.

395
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,259
                  Have you now?

396
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:15,298
 How does the Night's
 Watch vow go again?

397
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,935
  I'll bet you've
  got it memorized
  since you got here.

398
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:22,622
           Night gathers and
           now my watch begins.

399
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:26,293
          No, not that bit.
          The bit at the end.

400
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:28,795
               I am the sword
               in the darkness,

401
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:30,630
      the watcher on the walls,

402
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:32,799
      the shield that
      guards the realms of men.

403
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,667
            I pledge my life...
          Right, that's enough.

404
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,104
   The shield that
   guards the realms of men.

405
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,889
 That's what you swore to be.

406
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,325

    I give voice to
    the will of the gods

555

    and am their foremost
    servant in this world.

556

    An insult to me is
    an insult to the gods.

557
00:42:44,379 --> 00:42:48,514
 An assault on my person
 is an assault on
 our very religion.

       You were assaulted?
 I was.

559
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,269
  By those fanatics
  who call themselves Sparrows.

560
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,937
 They humiliated me,
 they beat me,

561
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:57,990
 they left me
 naked and bleeding
 on the cobblestones.

563
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,678
 I heard
 this assault began in
 Littlefinger's brothel.

564
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,632
        This is a rather
        shocking thing to hear.

 to the needs of
 these devout prostitutes?

568
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,710
        A man's private affairs
        ought to stay private.

 criminals and throwing them
 in the Black Cells.

00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,891
 I ask that you
 execute their leader,
 this so-called High Sparrow.

574

 He's a threat to

602
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:04,116
   Because I gave them away
   to someone who
   needed them more.

603

                We all do that.

      Everyone? Hard enough job
      reminding myself.

  Well,
  I tell them no one's special,

609
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,051
   and they think I'm

  more careful with the blade.

 to speak to me today.

 He doesn't want
 me to arrest you.

 Having a man like
 that reside in the sept

 eats away at
 the faith from the inside.

 So now he resides
 in the Red Keep

     question our new alliance.
