1
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,609
   Your Grace, I want to say...

2
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:09,077
            You will not speak.

3
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:13,665
          How do I know you are
          who you say you are?

4
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,301
 If only I were otherwise.

5
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,337
   If you are Tyrion Lannister,
   why shouldn't I kill you

6
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,006
       to pay your family back
       for what it did to mine?

7
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,576
 You want revenge
 against the Lannisters?

8
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:28,547
 I killed my mother,
 Joanna Lannister,
 on the day I was born.

9
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,450
 I killed my father,
 Tywin Lannister,
 with a bolt to the heart.

10
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,752
 I am the greatest
 Lannister killer of our time.

11
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,971
            So I should welcome
            you into my service

12
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,190
   because you murdered members
   of your own family?

13
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,460
 Into your service?

14
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,198
 We have only just met.

15
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,400
 It's too soon to know
 if you deserve my service.

16
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:52,471
         If you'd rather return
         to the fighting pits,
         just say the word.

17
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,060
 When I was a young man,
 I heard a story

18
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:02,046
 about a baby born
 during the worst
 storm in living memory.

19
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,483
 She had no wealth,
 no lands, no army,
 only a name

20
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,086
 and a handful of supporters,
 most of whom probably thought

21
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,872
 they could use that name
 to benefit themselves.

22
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,441
 They kept her alive,
 moving her from
 place to place,

23
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,411
 often hours ahead
 of the men who'd
 been sent to kill her.

24
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,798
 She was eventually
 sold off to some warlord
 on the edge of the world

25
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,166
 and that appeared to be that.

26
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:26,538
 Then, a few years later,
 the most
 well-informed person I knew

27
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,274
 told me that this girl
 without wealth,
 lands, or armies

28
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:32,744
 had somehow acquired all three
 in a very short span of time,

29
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,129
 along with three dragons.

30
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:38,833
 He thought she was our best,
 last chance to
 build a better world.

31
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,655
 I thought you
 were worth meeting,
 at the very least.

32
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,390
 And why are you worth meeting?

33
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,392
         Why should I spend my
         time listening to you?

34
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,161
 Because you cannot build
 a better world on your own.

35
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,066
 You have no one
 at your side who understands
 the land you want to rule,

36
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,634
 the strengths and
 weaknesses of the houses

37
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,102
 that will either
 join or oppose you.

38
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,304
 I will have a very large army.

39
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,573
        And very large dragons.

40
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,159
 Killing and politics
 aren't always the same thing.

41
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,028
 When I served as
 Hand of the King,

42
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,396
 I did quite well
 with the latter,

43
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:09,798
 considering
 the king in question

44
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:13,535
 preferred torturing animals
 to leading his people.

45
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:17,789
 I could do an even
 better job advising
 a ruler worth the name.

46
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,624
 If that is
 indeed what you are.

47
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,293
      So you want to advise me?

48
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:26,181
                Very well.

49
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,517
           What would you
           have me do with him?

50
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,405
       I swore I would kill
       him if he ever returned.

51
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,758
     I know.

52
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,932
   Why should
   the people trust a queen
   who can't keep her promises?

53
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,388
            Whomever Ser Jorah
            was when he started
            informing on you,

54
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,291
 he is no longer that man.

55
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,710
 I can't remember
 ever seeing a sane man
 as devoted to anything

56
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,046
 as he is to serving you.

57
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,581
 He claims he
 would kill for you
 and die for you

58
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,651
 and nothing I have witnessed
 gives me reason to doubt him.

59
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,557
     And yet he did betray you.

60
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,106
 Did he have an opportunity
 to confess his betrayal?

61
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:26,207
                   Yes.

62
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,577
            Many opportunities.

63
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,179
 TYRION: And did he?

64
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,714
                  DAENERYS: No.

65
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,100
     Not until forced to do so.

66
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,175
 He worships you.

67
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,326
 He is in love
 with you, I think.

68
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,013
 But he did not trust
 you with the truth.

69
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,748
 An unpleasant
 truth to be sure,

70
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,334
 but one of great
 significance to you.

71
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:55,504
 He did not trust
 that you would be wise
 enough to forgive him.

72
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,357
          So I should kill him?

73
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,626
 A ruler who kills
 those devoted to her

74
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,495
 is not a ruler who
 inspires devotion.

75
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,665
 And you're going to
 need to inspire devotion,
 a lot of it,

76
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:10,702
 if you're ever going to rule
 across the Narrow Sea.

77

 have him by your side

93

00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,534
        and decides he does not
        have to pay after all.

144
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:47,138
 A destitute woman
 and her small child,
 what can they do to such a man

145
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,690
             if he keeps their
             money for himself?

146
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:54,079
             To whom can they
             turn for recourse?

 The Many-Faced God.

149
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,773
 You said you didn't know
 what I would see at the docks.

150
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:09,460
        A man had no idea
        what a girl would see
        and what she would not.

151
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,398
      A girl named Lanna
      will return to the docks.

152
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,900
    She will watch the gambler.

153
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:19,137
    She will come to
    know as much about him
    as she knows about herself.

154
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,437
   And then what?

155
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,909
       A gift for the thin man.

156
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,631
   She's not ready.

157
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,334
             Perhaps she is,
             perhaps she's not.

158
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,804
 And if she's not?

159
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,673
         It is all the same
         to the Many-Faced God.

               The trial will
               take place soon.

163
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,050
             The High Sparrow
             will be presenting

164
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,852
              a substantial
              case against you.

165
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,387
     The charges?

166
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:30,257
  Fornication, treason, incest,
  the murder of King Robert.

167
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:31,459
         All lies.

168
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:32,627
                  Of course.

169
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:41,418
      My concern is that
      the Faith does not adhere

170
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:45,139
         to the same standards
         of proof as the crown.

171
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,408
       I hope you'll
       excuse me for saying it,

172
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:49,643
     but belief is so
     often the death of reason.

173
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,779
 I wish you had said it sooner.

174
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,167
 Is there any word from Jaime?

175
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,985
            No, I'm afraid not.

  back from Casterly Rock

178
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,951
  to serve as Hand of the King.

179
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,537
        He now presides
        over the Small Council.

180
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,374
 Tell him I need
 to speak to him.

181
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,710
   I implored him to visit you,
   but he would not.

182
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,083
 What about my son, the king?

183
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:32,353
 If you can visit me,
 then surely the king...

184
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:34,722
          Your arrest and Queen
          Margaery's arrest...

185
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,507
               The king has not
               taken them well.

186
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,509
    He remains in his chambers.

187
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,228
   His servants
   often find his food
   in the hall, left untouched.

188
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,531
 You need to talk to him.

189
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,733
 You need to talk to my son
 and tell him to
 come and see me,

190
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,967
 come and see his mother.

191
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:50,704
            He... I tried.
            He wouldn't see me.

192
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:52,523
           He won't see anyone.

193
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,259
 I can't stay here.

194
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,580
              There is a way.

195
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,935
                A way out.

196
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,589
     Confess?

197
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,210
 To the High Sparrow? I won't.

198
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,080
      I made him.

199
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,283
 I rose him up from nothing.

200
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,019
 I will not kneel before
 some barefooted commoner

201
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,721
 and beg his forgiveness.

202
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,331
                       Goodbye.

203

            The work continues.

204
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,238
  Why?

205
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,025
 Why, Theon?

206
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:21,229
  Not Theon. There is no Theon.

207
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:22,663
                 Reek.
    Reek.

208
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,965
 Why did you tell him, Reek?

209
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:28,603
             I was helping you.

210
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,037
          You wanted to escape.

211
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:31,756
            There is no escape.

212
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,358
                   Not ever.

213
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,594
 Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

214
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,898
               The master knew.

215
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,434
           He knows everything.

216
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:49,573
   He hunted him and caught him
   and strapped him to a cross

217
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:53,577
 and cut away piece after piece
 until there was no Theon left.

218
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,500
          Good.

219
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,941
 If it weren't for you,
 I'd still have a family.

220
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,725
 If I could do
 what Ramsay
 did to you

221
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,929
 right here,
 right now, I would.

222
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,502
         I deserved everything.

223
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,473
          I deserve to be Reek.

224
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,776
         I did terrible things.

225
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,614
                Turned on Robb.

226
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,250
           Captured Winterfell.

227
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,719
             Killed those boys.

228
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,019
 They weren't "those boys."

229
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,122
 They were Bran and Rickon.
 They were your brothers.

230
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,724
 You'd known them
 since they were born.

231
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,191
              They weren't.
              They were only...

232
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,326
 Only what?

233
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,012
             I can't.
         Tell me.

234
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:46,581
    I can't,
    not unless the master says.

235
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,815
 Tell me. They weren't what?
                They weren't...

236
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:50,084
 Tell me why Bran and
 Rickon should be gone

237
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,286
  while you still
  breathe the air.

238
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:55,389
 Tell me to my face, Theon.
 Tell me that they
 weren't your brothers!

239
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,974
  They weren't Bran and Rickon!

240
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,944
          I couldn't find them.

241
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,653
          It was two farm boys.

242
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,793
  I killed them and burned them
  so no one would know.

243
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:22,883
      You didn't...

244
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,587
 Do you know where they went,
 Bran and Rickon?

245
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:28,021
  I can't talk to you anymore.

246
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,123
 Theon, you have to tell me.
 Do you have any idea where...

247
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,326
              Not Theon! Reek!

248
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,629
          (DOOR SLAMS)

249
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:41,185
            Our scouts tell us
            he's got no more
            than 6,000 men.

250
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,187
        More than half of those
        are mounted, however.

251
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,357
 And how high do
 Stannis' horses jump?

252
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,392
 Our walls have
 been fully repaired.

253
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,962
 The gates have
 been reinforced.

254
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,697
 We have enough
 food for six months.

255
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:57,868
 We are more
 prepared for a siege
 than they could ever be.

256
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:03,207
 All we have to do
 is wait for them
 to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

257
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:07,628
     You disagree?

258
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:11,949
  Stannis isn't from the North.
  You are, Father.

259
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,584
         I think you're
         missing an opportunity

260
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,153
        to show
        the people of the North

261
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,955
      how House Bolton
      treats southern invaders.

262
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,190
 And what do you recommend?

263
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,924
     That we not sit and
     wait for Stannis to decide

264
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,127
           what sort of fight
           this is going to be.

265
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:27,331
         That we hit first
         and hit hard and leave
         a feast for the crows.

266
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,169
 A smart commander does not
 abandon a defensive advantage.

267
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:34,172
 As long as we stay
 behind these walls,
 they can't touch us.

268
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,923
 Not to mention that
 the snow is so deep,

269
00:19:35,992 --> 00:19:37,557
   we couldn't get
   an army through

270
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,093
 to engage them
 even if we wanted to.

271
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:40,994
          I don't need an army.

272
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:43,964
            I need 20 good men.

273
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:53,874
      So, have you decided yet?

274
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,076
        Whether I'm
        worthy of your service?

275
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:01,882
 Have you decided yet
 whether you're
 going to have me killed?

276
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,850
        It's probably
        my safest option.

277
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:09,423
 I could see why
 you would think so.

278
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:11,291
 It's what your
 father would have done.

279
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:13,844
         And what would
         your father have done?

280
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,484
 My father, who publically
 sentenced me to death?

281
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,603
 I'd say his thoughts
 on having me killed
 were abundantly clear.

282
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:24,822
    Is that why you killed him?

283
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,679
 Someday, if you
 decide not to execute me,

284
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:34,014
 I'll tell you all about
 why I killed my father.

285
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,417
  And on that day,
  should it ever come,

286
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,419
     we'll need more
     wine than this.

287
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,240
     I know what my father was.

288
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,793
                   What he did.

289
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:48,862
          I know the Mad
          King earned his name.

290
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:55,035
  So, here we sit.

291
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:57,989
 Two terrible children
 of two terrible fathers.

292
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,623
                  I'm terrible?

293
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,625
 I've heard stories.

294
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,194
      Why did you travel to
      the far side of the world

295
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,079
      to meet someone terrible?

296
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:07,081
 To see if you were
 the right kind of terrible.

297
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,648
      Which kind is that?

298
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:11,285
 The kind that
 prevents your people
 from being even more so.

299
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:15,022
       Well, I did reopen
       the fighting pits.

300
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:17,892
     Under my rule,
     murder will once again
     become entertainment.

301
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,826
 Yes, that was wise.

302
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:23,063
 And you agreed to
 marry someone you loathe
 for the greater good.

303
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:24,231
 Very impressive.

304
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:28,835
 My own sister married someone
 she loathed as well,

305
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:30,120
 though not by choice,

306
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:33,291
    and certainly not
    for the greater good,
    gods forbid.

307
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,758
      She ended up
      having him killed.

308
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,229
         Perhaps
         it won't come to that.

309
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,773
 It's not impossible
 that Varys was right
 about you after all.

310
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,843
       Varys?
       King Robert's spymaster?

311
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,379
 Yes,
 he's the one who convinced me
 to come find you.

312
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,632
    He was my
    traveling companion,

313
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:00,467
   before Ser Jorah seized
   that role for himself.

314
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:03,737
              Jorah sent my
              secrets to Varys.

315
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:07,090
       For 20 years, the spider
       oversaw the campaign
       to find and kill me.

316
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,843
 He did what he had
 to do to survive.

317
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,013
 He did a lot of
 other things as well,
 things he didn't have to do.

318
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,683
 I suspect he's the main
 reason you weren't
 slaughtered in your crib.

319
00:22:17,854 --> 00:22:18,986
             But you trust him?

320
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:20,221
 Yes, oddly.

321
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:23,090
 He may be the only
 person in the world I trust.

322
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:25,726
   Except my brother.

323
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:27,828
              The brother who
              killed my father?

324
00:22:28,464 --> 00:22:29,696
         That's the one.

325
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,515
          Perhaps I will have
          you killed after all.

326
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,117
 Your queenly prerogative.

327
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,371
 I had given up on life

328
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,925
 until Varys convinced me
 you might be worth living for.

329
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:46,013
 You chop off my head,
 well, my final days
 were interesting.

330
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,388
     I'm not going to kill you.

331
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,542
              No?

332
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,128
           Banish me?
                       No.

333
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:02,596
 So if I'm not
 going to be murdered

334
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:03,997
    and I'm not going
    to be banished...

335
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,565
     You're going to advise me.

336
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,703
      While you can still speak
      in complete sentences.

337
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,359
   Advise you on what?

338
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:16,860
        How to get what I want.

339
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,462
 The Iron Throne.

340
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,266
  Perhaps you should try
  wanting something else.

341
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,902
               If I want jokes,
               I'll get myself
               a proper fool.

342
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,003
 I'm not entirely joking.

343
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,840
 There's more to
 the world than Westeros.

344
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,959
 How many hundreds
 of thousands of lives

345
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:34,027
 have you changed
 for the better here?

346
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,829
 Perhaps this is
 where you belong,

347
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:37,564
 where you can
 do the most good.

348
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,702
      I fought so that no child
      born into Slaver's Bay

349
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:45,856
  would ever know what it meant
  to be bought or sold.

350
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:49,543
         I will continue that
         fight here and beyond.

351
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,312
       But this is not my home.

352
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,114
    When you get
    back to your home,
    who supports you?

353
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,682
             The common people.

354
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:58,402
    Let's be generous
    and assume that's
    going to happen.

355
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,587
 Here in Slaver's Bay,
 you had the support
 of the common people

356
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,890
 and only the common people.

357
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,024
 What was that like?

358
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,593
 Ruling without the rich?

359
00:24:07,396 --> 00:24:09,496
 House Targaryen is gone.

360
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:12,949
 Not a single person
 who shares your blood
 is alive to support you.

361
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,320
 The Starks are gone as well.
 Our two terrible
 fathers saw to that.

362
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:20,274
 The remaining
 members of House Lannister
 will never back you, not ever.

363
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:22,743
 Stannis Baratheon
 won't back you, either.

364
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:26,063
 His entire claim to
 the throne rests on
 the illegitimacy of yours.

365
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,032
 That leaves the Tyrells.

      Lannister, Targaryen,
      Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,274

        then that one's on top.

371

  And on and on it spins,
  crushing those on the ground.

372
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,534
 It's a beautiful dream,
 stopping the wheel.

 who's ever dreamt it.

00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,207

380
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,289
      I won.

 It's about the Lord Commander.

424
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:37,063
                      Yes?

425
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,033
 He's going up to Hardhome
 to save all them wildlings.

426
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,138
 Wildlings killed
 my mum and dad.

427
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:46,857
 They killed
 everyone in my village.

428
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,458
       We've been
       fighting them for years.

429
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,176
 This wasn't a fight.

430
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:52,011
 We were farmers.

431
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,647
 They slaughtered us.

432
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,016
 So why is he saving them?

433
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:59,820
          Wildlings are people.

434
00:28:59,888 --> 00:29:02,622
            Just like us,
            there are good ones
            and bad ones.

435
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:06,042
 The one he's traveling with,
 with the red beard,

436
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,612
 he led the raid on my village.

437
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,347
                    Oh, Olly...
     How can he trust him?

438
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,501
          I've seen
          the army of the dead.

439
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,888
   I've seen the White Walkers.

440
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,924
     And they're coming for us,
     for all the living.

          last man we can find.

443
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,784
      But what if we
      let the wildlings
      through the gates

444
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,653
   and they cut our
   throats while we sleep?

445
00:29:33,722 --> 00:29:36,523
           Jon's taking a risk,
           but he has to.

          to make hard choices,

448
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:44,664
          choices that might
          look wrong to others,

         right in the long run.
