1
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,397
                JAIME: I made
                a deal for you,

2
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:58,466
        to keep your ungrateful
        head on your neck
        a little while longer.

3
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,168
 TYRION: I'm sorry,
 what am I grateful for?

4
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:02,237
 The opportunity to
 live and die at the Wall

5
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:04,222
    as punishment
    for a crime
    I did not commit?

6
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,225
      You threw your life away.

7
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,660
           It's not a joke.
           You understand that,
           don't you?

8
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,880
 Of course it's a joke,
 just not a very funny one.

9
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:20,922
  I couldn't listen
  to her standing there,
  telling her lies.

10
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:23,292
   I couldn't do it.

11
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,960
               You fell in love
               with a whore.

12
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:27,612
         Yes.

13
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,147
  And I was stupid
  enough to think

14
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,598
 that she had fallen
 in love with me.

15
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:38,106
 That deal you made,

16
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:40,308
 it was everything
 Father wanted.

17
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:43,812
 You do see that?
 He gets you back
 as his heir.

18
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:45,981
  The future
  Lord of the Rock.

19
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,751
 And he ships me off
 to Castle Black,
 out of sight at last.

20
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:53,155
   All so perfect.

21
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:59,878
 It felt good to take
 that from him.

22
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,882
 He knows I'm innocent
 and he's willing to
 sacrifice me anyway.

23
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,083
           He's willing to
           sacrifice any of us.

24
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,134
     Not you.

25
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:09,470
 You're the golden son.

26
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,640
 You could kill a king,
 lose a hand,

27
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,909
  fuck your own sister,
  you'll always be
  the golden son.

28
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:15,911
                    Careful.

29
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:18,279
             I'm the last
             friend you've got.

30
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:24,953
 At least I got to tell
 them what they really are.

31
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:27,255
         Yes, brilliant speech.

32
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:30,142
             They'll be talking
             about it
             for days to come.

33
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,511
                I thought you
                were a realist.

34
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,813
           Didn't realize
           you'd die for pride.

35
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,866
 Don't give up
 on me just yet.

36
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,868
 I survived one
 trial by combat,

37
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:42,003
 even though you weren't
 there to save me.

38
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:45,907
              I can't save you
              this time either.

39
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:50,545
  My training has proved
  that I can't beat a
  stable boy with my left hand.

40
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:55,384
  Where's your
  sense of adventure?

41
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,101
 Even if you lose,
 imagine the look

42
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,737
   on Father's face
   when you fall.

                     (CHUCKLES)

44
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:03,408
 Our family name snuffed
 out with a single
 swing of the sword.

45
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,028
            It is tempting.
 (LAUGHS)

46
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,795
     Well...

47
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,632
 Bronn fought for me once,
 he'll do it again.

48
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,035
     If he wins,

49
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,571
 I expect I'll be
 in his debt for
 the rest of my life.

50
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:34,539
                  If he wins.

51
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,491
 Will you find him for me?

52
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:42,648
 Who does Cersei plan
 on naming as a champion?

53
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,550
 I hope it's
 Ser Meryn Trant.

54
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,820
 I'd enjoy watching Bronn
 disembowel that
 pompous child beater.

55
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:51,106
                         No.

56
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:53,608
                 Not Ser Meryn.

 Thank you for riding
 here so quickly.

   in good form.

            Who am I fighting?

00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,634
  Does it matter?

74
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,793
 Could be food.

    Could be soldiers.

 (MAN GROANING)

77
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,689
       You shouldn't be
       sitting out here
       like this.

78
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:50,325

79
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:52,961
             Tried to walk
             back to me hut,

80
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:55,563
             hurt too much.

81
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:58,433
       Then I remembered
       they burned me hut down.

82
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,368
          Who were "they"?

83

           a while ago.

00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,744
               That's not going
               to get better.

85

86
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,780
               A bad way to go.

89
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,007
               I know.

90
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,376
              Time to go.

91
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,530
           Take matters
           into me own hands.

               The thought has
               occurred to me.

94
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:38,639
   So why go on?

 worse than this.

              worse than this.

 as your sort of girl.

         a single sort of girl.

 She's dim-witted.

              I'd marry you.

 When my sister arranged
 this love match,

221

 did she mention
 that Lollys has
 an older sister?

             Aye, I did know.

 And you understand the
 rules of inheritance?

225

       Falyse is 40 and barren.

226
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:59,680
 She still gets
 Castle Stokeworth
 when her father dies.

231

 Why did you bother
 to come here?

234
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,756
           You once said if
           anyone ever asked me

235
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,259
         to sell you out, you'd
         double their price.

236
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,227
    Is it two wives you
    want or two castles?

237
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,296
           One of each will do.

238
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,233
           But if you want me
           to kill the Mountain
           for you,

239
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,769
             it'd better be
             a damn big castle.

240
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,870
 I'm a bit short on
 castles at the moment.

241
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,206
 But I can offer you
 gold and gratitude.

242
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,807
                 I have gold.

243
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,109
                What can I buy

 to Winterfell.

 with my head still
 on my shoulders,

249
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,025
 I may one day rule

250
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,911
 I could carve you out
 a big piece of it.

251
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,780
          If and may and could.

252

       And close.

254
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,355
       If I gave you the choice

255
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,490
     between fucking Lollys
     and fighting the Mountain,

256
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,310
       you'd have your britches
       down and your cock out
       before I could blink.

257
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,578
 Does he frighten
 you so much?

258
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,930
        I'd be a bloody fool if
        he didn't frighten me.

259
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,349
                He's freakish
                big and strong.

260
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,468
            And quicker than
            you'd expect for
            a man of that size.

261
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,856
        Maybe I could take him,

262
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,325
            dance around
            until he's so tired
            of hacking at me,

263
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:38,096
          he dropped his sword,
          get him off
          his feet somehow.

264
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,831
                But one misstep

265
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,999
                  and I'm dead.

00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,501
          Why should I risk it?

267

 Because you're my friend.

             pampered little
             shit that you are.

272
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,425
                   I just like
                   myself more.

273
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,143
 I understand.

274
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:10,561
               I'm sorry it has
               to be this way.

275
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,213
 Why are you sorry?

276
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,834
 Because you're an evil
 bastard with no
 conscience and no heart?

277
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:20,104
 That's what I liked about
 you in the first place.

278
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:27,595
            We had some
            good days together.

279
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:29,296
      Yes, we did.

280
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,227
 (BANGS ON DOOR)

281
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,246
 What will you do?

282
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,066
           I suppose
           I'll have to kill
           the Mountain myself.

283
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,637
              Won't that make
              for a great song?

284
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,476
 I hope to hear them
 sing it one day.

285

       (BIRD SCREECHING)

286
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,863
    How did you get in here?

287
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,731
   Your door is well guarded,

288
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,466
        but your window is not.

289
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,059
            I swam to an island
            a mile offshore
            for these.

290
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:36,430
 Don't do that again.

291
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:39,199
              Never met a woman
              who didn't like
              wildflowers.

292
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,101
   These are my
   private quarters.

293
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,503
    If I want you here,
    I will summon you.

294
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,942
          Forgive me, my queen.
          I live to serve you.

295
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,567
 Tell me why you're here.

296
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,372
         I came to ask a favor.

297
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:05,459
         I only have two
         talents in this world.

298
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:07,561
                 War and women.

299
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,730
           You are staying here
           in Meereen to rule.

300
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,832
       That is a wise decision.
       I respect it.

301
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,067
           But here in Meereen,
           I cannot pursue
           my talents.

302
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,586
       I've ordered
       the Second Sons

303
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,071
 to patrol the streets to
 stop the revenge killings.

304
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,306
       You've ordered us
       to be night watchmen.

305
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,742
   And as for women,

306
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:25,162
   there are thousands
   in Meereen
   you can pursue.

307
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:28,415
             There is only one,

308
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:30,501
                 and she does
                 not want me.

309
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,571
    You swore me your sword.

310
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:35,990
        My sword is yours
        till the day I die.

311
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:39,843
 So if I command you
 to stay in Meereen
 and patrol the streets?

312
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,713
        I'll stay in Meereen
        and patrol the streets.

313
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:45,232
                Send me to kill
                your enemies.

314
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:47,284
            Any enemy anywhere.

315
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,855
      Let me do what I do best.

316
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,124
       Very well.

317
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:02,316
      Do what you do best.

318
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,446
 Take off your clothes.

319

320
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,926
                    Oh.

321
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:49,763
 Come in, my queen. Please.

322
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,431
  I didn't mean to
  disturb you, my lady.

323
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,800
   You could never.

324
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:54,935
 I just wanted to speak
 with you before we left.

325
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,471
 Could you bring me
 that vial over there?

326
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:02,393
         The blue one.

327
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:07,631
            No, not that one.

328
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,567
          You don't even want
          to touch that one.

329
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,001
                Next to it.

330
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,071
             That's the one.

            (INHALES)

332
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,661
 When I looked into
 the flames this morning,
 the Lord spoke to me.

333
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,863
      He said,

334
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:43,868
 "Tonight, you will have
 your last good bath
 in a long while.

335
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,536
  "Make it count."

336
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,942
             A joke.
             (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

337
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,677
       Not a very good one,
       I'm afraid.

338
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:54,778
                   It was. I...

339
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,365
       Humor isn't my strength.

340
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:00,467
       That's because
       most jokes are lies

341
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:02,870
        and you're devoted
        to the truth.

342
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:06,256
             If they're lies,
             my lady, aren't
             they best avoided?

343
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,691
            Not always.

344
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,738
 Most of these
 powders and potions

345
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,322
    are lies.

346
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:26,677
 Deceptions to make men
 think they witnessed
 our Lord's power.

347
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:30,347
 Once they step into
 his light, they will see
 the lie for what it was,

348
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,517
 a trick that led
 them to the truth.

349
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,519
 A pinch of this
 powder in a bonfire

350
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:39,757
 will send a flaming column
 screaming towards the sky.

351
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,142
 And this one
 creates a black smoke

352
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,129
 that will make
 the bravest man
 piss himself with fear.

353
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,950
 And a drop of this
 in any man's wine will
 drive him wild with lust.

354
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,739
             Did you use it
             with Stannis?

355
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:56,840
      No.

356
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:01,829
   Don't be upset.

357
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:04,264
 Men never crave what
 they already have.

358
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:07,634
   It's only flesh.

359
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:11,038
 It needs what it needs.

360
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:19,680
        No act done in
        service of the Lord can
        ever be called a sin.

361
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,084
        I thank God every day
        for bringing you to us.

362
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,687
            And Stannis to you.

363
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:30,357
 He wants to bring
 Shireen with us.

364
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,429
 I think that would
 be ill-advised.

365
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:39,333
 My daughter has
 heretical tendencies,
 as you're well aware.

366
00:23:39,402 --> 00:23:42,703
 I don't know if her
 doubt is real or simply
 meant to spite me,

367
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:45,889
 but whichever the case,
 she should stay home.

368
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,996
                  I understand
                  how you feel.

369
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,199
        But that is impossible.

370
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:00,403
     Why?

371
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,509
           You don't need
           powders and potions,
           my queen.

372
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,945
           You don't need lies.

373
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,780
            You are strong
            enough to look into

374
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,916
              the Lord's light
              and see his truth
              for yourself.

375
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:20,941
 However harsh it is.

376
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,443
 However hard for
 us to understand.

377
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,249
 You don't need my help,
 but I will need yours soon.

378
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:32,436
 When we set sail,
 your daughter
 must be with us.

379
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,941
 The Lord needs her.

380
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,834
               Jorah the Andal.

381
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:51,571
              Are you here
              to see our queen?

382
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,008
          She's in a good mood.

383
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,792
 Khaleesi.

384
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:13,977
    You're here early.
 Later than some.

385
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:17,898
             You don't approve?

386
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:19,166
 It's not
 a question of approval,

387
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:20,768
                it's a question
                of trust.

388
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:22,535
           You neither
           approve nor trust.

389
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,404
                   Why would I?
                   The man's
                   a sellsword.

390
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:25,889
         Didn't you fight for
         the Golden Company

391
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,991
 before pledging your
 sword to my brother?

392
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,593
                   I did.

393
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:30,794
 I trust you.

394
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,364
 Daario Naharis
 killed his captains

395
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:34,931
  and dumped their
  heads at your feet

396
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,700
 when he grew tired
 of their commands.

397
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,702
 How could you
 ever have faith
 in a man like that?

398
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:42,122
             I could never have
             faith in a man
             like Daario.

399
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,309
        That's why I've sent
        him and the Second Sons
        to retake Yunkai.

400
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,848
   You have?
                   I have.

401
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,883
 Without you there
 to rule, Khaleesi,

402
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,252
 I fear the masters will
 simply bide their time,

403
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,570
 wait for the invaders
 to leave and
 reassert control.

404
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,339
            That is why
            I've ordered Daario

405
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:01,391
              to execute every
              master in Yunkai.

406
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,678
      The masters tear babies
      from their mothers' arms.

407
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:08,164
         They mutilate little
         boys by the thousands.

408
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,651
        They train little girls
        in the art of
        pleasuring old men.

409
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:13,687
          They treat men
          like beasts,
          as you said yourself.

410
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:17,157
 Herding the masters
 into pens and slaughtering
 them by the thousands

411
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:19,460
 is also treating
 men like beasts.

412
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:23,731
 The slaves you freed,
 brutality is all
 they've ever known.

413
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,532
 If you want them to
 know something else,

414
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,634
   you'll have to
   show it to them.

415
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:30,938
       And repay the slavers
       with what? Kindness?
       A fine? A stern warning?

416
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,773
 It's tempting to see
 your enemies as evil,
 all of them,

417
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,477
 but there's good and evil
 on both sides in
 every war ever fought.

418
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:39,212
          Let the priests argue
          over good and evil.

419
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,014
               Slavery is real.

420
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,916
                 I can end it.
                 I will end it,

421
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:45,386
           and those behind it.

422
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:47,971
 I sold men into
 slavery, Khaleesi.

423
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:53,227
     And now you are helping me
     show them to freedom.

424
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:55,729
 I wouldn't be here
 to help you if Ned Stark
 had done to me

425
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:58,565
 what you want to do to
 the masters of Yunkai.

426
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:06,556
      The man who came
      to me the other day
      about burying his father.

427
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,659
 Hizdahr zo Loraq?

428
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,328
              He will accompany
              the Second Sons

429
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,497
          and serve as my
          ambassador to Yunkai.

430
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,300
       He will tell the masters
       what has happened
       in Meereen.

431
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,903
              He will explain
              the choice they
              have before them.

432
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:24,758
        They can live in my new
        world or they can die
        in their old one.

433
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,782
       Well, go and catch
       Daario before he leaves.

434
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,216
               Tell him I
               changed my mind.

435
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,886
   Yes, Khaleesi.

436
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,442
                      No.

437
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,632
               Tell him you
               changed my mind.

438
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:01,862
 HOUND: (GRUNTS) Rat cunts.

439
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,116
  Fucking whore.

440
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:10,253
 You're doing it wrong.

441
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,589
   You need to burn away
   that horrible bit there.

442
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:15,124
 Otherwise it's gonna
 get infected and fester.

443
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,296
          I know you don't
          like fire, but if you
          don't do it right...

444
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,048
                 No fire.

445
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,635
 It'll only take a second.

446
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:26,753
       It won't hurt that much.

447
00:28:26,822 --> 00:28:28,188
    No fire!

448
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,588
    Shut up about it.

449
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,826
     About everything.

450
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,195
   Thanks to you,
   I'm a walking
   bag of silver

451
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:56,033
 anywhere the Lannisters
 hold sway.

452
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,802
 Which is everywhere
 between where we are now
 and where we're going.

453
00:29:02,358 --> 00:29:05,976
 I'm as stupid as that hog
 you stuck back
 in the village,

454
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:10,080
 getting myself cut
 and stabbed and bitten.

455
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:15,469
             No reward is worth
             this much trouble.

456
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:17,770
 Wish I'd never
 laid eyes on you.

457
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:30,767
           You say your brother
           gave you that sword.

458
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:35,321
       My brother gave me this.

459
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:40,293
           It was just like you
           said a while back.

460
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:44,330
         Pressed me to the fire
         like I was a nice
         juicy mutton chop.

461
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,452
            Why?

462
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,221
               Thought I stole
               one of his toys.

463
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,507
             I didn't steal it.
             I was just
             playing with it.

464
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,047
              The pain was bad.

465
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:02,432
           The smell was worse.

466
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:10,423
         But the worst thing
         was that it was
         my brother who did it.

467
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:17,163
             My father,
             who protected him,

468
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,901
           told everyone my
           bedding caught fire.

469
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:36,949
               You think you're
               on your own?

470
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:43,640
           Let me wash it out
           and help you sew
           it up at least.

471
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,619
 BRIENNE: Bit of comfort
 never hurt anyone.

472
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,105
 We've been sleeping
 in ditches
 the last few weeks.

473
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:18,175
 I think we can treat
 ourselves to a featherbed
 for the night

474
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,510
     and a hot meal
     not cooked by you.

475
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,045
               Couldn't agree
               more, my lady.

476
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,347
      Just don't start
      expecting
      silk underclothes.

477
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,983
      Not working for your
      former lord any longer.
                  Yes, my lady.

478
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,152
 Don't get drunk.

479
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:31,588
                 No, my lady.

480
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,989
 HOT PIE: Can I
 get you anything else?

481
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,858
     No, this will do
     nicely, thank you.

482
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:36,326
 Kidney pie is wonderful.

483
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,695
          Thanks.

484
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,530
             I do my best.

485
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,701
              A good kidney pie
              is all about
              the ingredients.

486
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,820
       Flour, lard,
       water, eggs, milk.

487
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,940
 Easy enough. But the meat,

488
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:52,576
   peacetime or not,
   getting your hands on
   a good bottom round steak

489
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,311
      and calves' kidneys
      is not easy.

490
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,280
 I mean,
 some people settle for
 plain old beef kidneys.

491
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,633
 Got no right to
 cook anything, them.
 Oh, and the gravy.

492
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:02,652
 Don't get me started
 on the gravy.

493
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,154
 Very difficult
 to get right.

494
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,989
 See, a lot of people
 give up on the gravy.

495
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,191
      You cannot give up.

496
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,893
       No gravy, no pie.

497
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,261
                Simple as that.

498
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,632
       That's nice armor.
       Are you a knight?

499
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,469
                            No.

500
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,389
       Oh, it's just
       people with armor
       are usually knights.

501
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,074
      Generally speaking.
      From King's Landing,
      though, aren't you?

502
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,944
 From there myself originally.
 Flea Bottom born and bred.

503
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:30,663
        What brings you
        to these parts?

504
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:31,915
 We're looking for someone.

505
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,267
     Someone in particular?
     Maybe they came in here.

506
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:36,653
        A lot of people come
        in here. Just the other
        day we had 17...

507
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:38,772
      A girl, tall, red hair,
      very pretty.

508
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:42,042
 Her name is Sansa Stark,
 but she may be using
 a different name.

509
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,293
              Starks?

510
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,833
      What, like them lot
      from "Winterhell"?

511
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,872
          No, ain't seen
          anyone like that.

512
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,241
               I heard they was
               all traitors.

513
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,842
              Don't need no
              traitors in here.

514
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,179
              I pledged my life
              to their mother
              Catelyn Stark.

515
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,232
    I swore to her I'd bring
    her daughters home.

516
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,672
   Sure I can't get you
   a bit more kidney pie?

517
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:28,104
                         What?

518
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,173
 It's nothing, my lady.

519
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,742
       You wouldn't be screwing
       your face up like that
       if it was nothing.

520
00:33:32,795 --> 00:33:34,978
 Don't want to offend,
 my lady. Truly, I don't.

521
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:36,763
        You're not interesting
        enough to be offensive.

522
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:41,601
   The Lannisters
   want Lady Sansa.

523
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,853
 The Lannisters have money.

524
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,689
 People kill for money.

525
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,592
 I don't think we should
 be telling people

526
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,093
   we're searching
   for Lady Sansa.

527
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:03,072
 My lady. My lord.
 Could I have a word?

528
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,891
                What about?
                Not kidney pie.

529
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,926
      You seem like
      a proper lady.

530
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:08,845
 Someone who could be trusted.

531
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,949
    I never met
    no Sansa Stark.

532
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,251
 But I know her sister.

533
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:16,986
        Arya.

534
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:23,360
       No one's seen Arya Stark
       since her father
       was beheaded.

535
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,812
           She's presumed dead.

536
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,631
 She weren't when I
 last spoke to her.

537
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:28,748
               When was that?

538
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,183
 Heading up north
 with the Night's Watch.

539
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:31,968
 She was all
 dressed up as a boy.

540
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,537
 Like your ladyship,
 only without the armor.

541
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:36,489
 Going by the name Arry.

542
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,208
               So what
               happened to her?
      Well...

543
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,492
             The quick version.

544
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,612
 The Lannisters
 took us prisoner.

545
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,947
   We escaped.

546
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:48,334
 The Brotherhood
 took us prisoner.
 They sold me to the innkeep.

547
00:34:48,403 --> 00:34:50,136
 They were gonna sell
 Arya to her mother

548
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:51,855
 at Riverrun along
 with another prisoner.

549
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:55,775
 Big ugly fellow.
 Foul mouth and a face
 like a half-burnt ham.

550
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,711
   Not friendly.
 The Hound.

551
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,096
 That's the one.

552
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:03,433
 If you find her,
 could you give her this?

553
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,168
 She liked the last
 one I gave her,

554
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,069
 but, well, this one
 turned out better.

555
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,214
                      Um...

556
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,183
               You were saying?

557
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:26,439
 BRIENNE:
 Her mother's dead,
 grandfather's dead,

558
00:35:26,508 --> 00:35:28,941
 Walder Frey is the new
 lord of Riverrun.

559
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,510
 The Brotherhood isn't
 going to Riverrun.

560
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:32,411
            They'll take her to
            the Eyrie, my lady.

561
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:34,614
 Why the Eyrie?

562
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:37,183
          Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

563
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:39,485
        Catelyn Stark's sister.

564
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,722
              She's Arya's last
              living relative
              with money.

565
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:45,024
                She hates
                the Lannisters.

566
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:50,063
          Lord Tyrion made sure
          I knew which
          house married which

567
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:52,065
             and who hated who.

568
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:54,801
           BRIENNE: Sansa
           could be there, too.

569
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,921
   PODRICK: Could be.

570
00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:06,312
 You sure about this?

571
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,234
                 No.

572
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,220
     (DOOR OPENS)

573
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:45,468
            I imagined you'd be
            back at the brothel
            at this hour.

574
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:50,039
 I did spend some time with
 an absolutely stunning
 blonde the other day.

575
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,610
                Mmm. Do tell.

576
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,247
        I've got every kind
        of filth down here
        except the kind I like.

577
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,832
 Your sister.

578
00:37:00,936 --> 00:37:01,951
                   Oh.

579
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,928
 Cersei approached me.

580
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,764
 We spoke a great deal
 about her daughter.

581
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,650
    How worried your
    sister is about her.

582
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,853
 She was trying
 very hard to pretend

583
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,988
 she had not come to
 sway me against you.

584
00:37:22,057 --> 00:37:24,690
 I think she may have
 even believed it herself.

585
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:29,996
      Making honest feelings
      do dishonest work
      is one of her many gifts.

586
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:33,015
 It was difficult for her
 to hide her true intentions.

587
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:38,588
     It is rare to
     meet a Lannister

588
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:42,525
 who shares my enthusiasm
 for dead Lannisters.

589
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,963
 She desperately wants
 to see you killed.

590
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:49,565
              She didn't need
              to bother you.

591
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:52,886
             It looks as though
             I've taken care
             of that myself.

592
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:57,990
          The joy she will feel
          when my head
          leaves my neck.

593
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:00,993
              She's wanted this
              for a long time.

594
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,930
     Yes, I know.

595
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,950
 We met, you and I.

596
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,552
   Many years ago.

597
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,621
           I think I would have
           remembered that.

598
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,991
 Unlikely.
 You had just been born.

599
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,496
 Our father brought
 me and my sister Elia

600
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,731
 with him on a visit
 to Casterly Rock.

601
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,900
 My first time
 away from Dorne.

602
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:27,570
 I didn't like anything
 about the Rock.

603
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,407
  Not the food,
  not the weather,
  not your accents.

604
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,976
      Nothing.

605
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,213
   But the biggest
   disappointment,

606
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,248
        you.

607
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,420
          You and my family
          have more in common
          than you might admit.

608
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:48,457
 The whole way from Dorne
 all anyone talked about was

609
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:52,962
 the monster
 that had been born
 to Tywin Lannister.

610
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,565
 A head twice the
 size of his body,

611
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,349
 a tail between his legs,

612
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,786
  claws, one red eye,

613
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:02,488
 the privates of both
 a girl and a boy.

614
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:04,857
         That would have made
         things so much easier.

615
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,260
 When we met your sister,
 she promised she
 would show you to us.

616
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:12,432
 Every day we would ask.
 Every day she
 would say, "Soon."

617
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:16,368
 Then she and your brother

618
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,887
    took us to your
    nursery and...

619
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,609
 ...she unveiled the freak.

620
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:29,516
 Your head was a bit large,
 your arms and legs
 were a bit small,

621
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,901
   but no claw.

622
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,470
 No red eye. No tail
 between your legs.

623
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,390
 Just a tiny pink cock.

624
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,825
 We didn't try to hide
 our disappointment.

625
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:42,228
 "That's not a monster,"
 I told Cersei.

626
00:39:43,265 --> 00:39:45,498
 "That's just a baby."

627
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,752
 And she said,
 "He killed my mother."

628
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,921
 And she pinched your
 little cock so hard,

629
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,056
 I thought she
 might pull it off.

630
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,191
 Until your brother
 made her stop.

631
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,694
 "It doesn't matter,"
 she told us.

632
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,930
 "Everyone says
 he will die soon.

633
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,832
 "I hope they are right.

634
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,367
 "He should not have
 lived this long."

635
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:10,873
               Well, (SNIFFLES)

636
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:18,180
             sooner or later,
             Cersei always gets
             what she wants.

637
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,753
  And what about
  what I want?

638
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,324
      Justice

639
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:31,327
  for my sister
  and her children.

640
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,429
           If you want justice,

641
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:36,266
               you've come to
               the wrong place.

642
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,467
   I disagree.

643
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:48,877
 I've come to
 the perfect place.

644
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,099
 I want to bring those
 who have wronged
 me to justice.

645
00:40:53,168 --> 00:40:56,068
 And all those
 who have wronged me
 are right here.

646
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,407
 I will begin with
 Ser Gregor Clegane,

647
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:03,609
 who killed my
 sister's children

648
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:07,096
 and then raped her
 with their blood
 still on his hands

649
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,865
 before killing her, too.

650
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,593
 I will be your champion.

651
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,479
              (EXHALES SHARPLY)

652
00:42:15,183 --> 00:42:16,949
             Hello, Robin.

653
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:20,436
 What are you doing?

654
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:23,272
      I'm building my home,
      Winterfell.

655
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:27,343
     At least I think I am.
     I haven't been back
     there in a very long time.

656
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:29,946
   Why did you leave?

657
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,281
           It's a long story.

658
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,335
 I stay here
 in the Eyrie.

659
00:42:35,403 --> 00:42:37,870
 Mother says it's dangerous
 on the roads and I have
 to keep myself safe

660
00:42:37,939 --> 00:42:39,739
 because I'm
 the Lord of the Vale

661
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:42,608
 and a very
 important person.

662
00:42:42,677 --> 00:42:44,493
        Yes, you certainly are.

663
00:42:45,413 --> 00:42:46,796
 When will you go back?

664
00:42:48,183 --> 00:42:49,782
             Probably never.

665
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:53,919
        My family doesn't
        live there anymore and
        someone burned it down.

666
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:56,788
         Oh.

667
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,175
 Does Winterfell
 have a Moon Door?

668
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,144
        No, I'm afraid not.

669
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:03,779
       It's not high up
       in the mountains.
       It's down on the ground.

670

671

 all the bad people

674
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:12,505
 and the scary people
 and the people
 you don't like?

675
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:14,557
           I never did anything
           with them at all.

676
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,759
           Girls didn't
           take part in that
           where I came from.

677
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:20,162
 Well, I'm Lord of the Vale.

678
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:23,733
 When I grow up,
 I'll be able to fly
 anybody who bothers me.

679
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:25,802
 Or you.
 When we get married,

680
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,670
 you can tell me if you
 don't like somebody

681
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,889
 and then we can
 bring them back here
 and, whoosh!

682
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:31,590
 Right through
 the Moon Door.

683
00:43:33,394 --> 00:43:35,311
      I like the sound of that.

 in your Winterfell.

            All right.

686
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,650
 It can go in here
 in this big tower.

687
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,751
                 Be careful.

688
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:44,303
       You've ruined it.
       Now I'm going to have to
       rebuild the whole thing.

689
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,871
 I didn't ruin it.
            You did.

690
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,707
 It was already ruined
 because it didn't
 have a Moon Door.

 I didn't ruin it!

                    Yes, I saw.

 what everything looked like.

  Why did you really
  kill Joffrey?

734
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:06,288
        what happens to bodies
        when they hit the rocks
        from such a height.

735
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:09,008

 them right apart.
