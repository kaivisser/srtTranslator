 You're wearing
 a black cloak again.

5
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,202
            I've been sent to
            negotiate with you.

6
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,834
 It appears my trusting nature
 got the better of me.

7
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,203
          It's happened before.

8
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,071
              I was hoping your
              loyalty was real

9
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,873
      when you pledged
      yourself to us, Jon Snow.

10
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,708
                  Truly, I was.

11
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,576
 The Halfhand ordered
 me to join your army

12
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,380
 and bring back
 whatever information
 I could to Castle Black.

13
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,899
 He made me kill him
 so you'd trust me.

14
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,617
 I was loyal

15
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,469
 to him and to my
 Night's Watch vows.

16
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:16,989
                 All your vows?

17
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,211
              She wasn't enough
              to turn you, eh?

18
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,947
                Were you enough
                to turn her?

19
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,784
 She put three arrows
 in me when I escaped.

20
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:33,538
         Did you see her
         again at Castle Black?

21
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,073
         Yes.

22
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,741
                      And?

23
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,843
    She's dead.

24
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,179

  poison would be the last.

34

             Killed some of

35
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,793
      One of our giants

38
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,598
 He killed my friend Grenn.

        before the First Men.

41
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,439
 Grenn came from a farm.

42
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,363
                 Mag and Grenn.

       I don't imagine our
       guest has eaten anything
       for quite some time.

46
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:21,112
             So, you're here to
             strike a bargain?

47
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,933

 around and go home.

         you're low on arrows,

49
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,320
             you're low on oil,
             you're low on men.

50
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,355
         How many are left, 50?

51
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,558
 I told Tormund and Orell.

52
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,192
 We have more than 1,000 men.

53
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,646
 I showed you everything I had.
 The whole army,
 100,000 strong.

54
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:42,300
           And what did you do?
           You fired on us with
           everything you had.

55
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:43,784
                It wasn't much.

56
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:48,005
         As soon as I saw that,
         I sent 400 men
         to climb the Wall,

57
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,575
       an unmanned stretch
       five miles west of here.

58
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,293
             A lot of them
             will die climbing,

59
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:55,063
  but most of them will be over
  by the end of the day.

60
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,665
           It's me being honest
           with you, Jon Snow,

61
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:00,168
       which is more than
       you've ever done for me.

62
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:02,636
    My people have bled enough.

63
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:04,072
     We're not here to conquer.

64
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,710
             We're here to hide
             behind your Wall.
             Just like you.

65
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:11,446
           We need your tunnel.

66
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,799
         Now we both know
         that winter is coming.

67
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:18,085
      And if my people
      aren't south of the Wall

      you open the gates to us,

71
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:30,297
     and I swear to you
     that no one else will die.

72

                        Refuse,

73
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:35,203
      and we'll kill every
      last man at Castle Black.

        That's why you're here.

77
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,567
       I reckon you could do it
       before any of
       them could stop you.

78
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,402
    They'd kill you, of course.

         when you came in here.

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,761
             Are you capable
             of that, Jon Snow?

 I was sent to discuss terms
 with the King-beyond-the-Wall.

      You will address
      him as "Your Grace."

 I know he's the king.
 My father died for him.

 My name is Jon Snow,
 Your Grace.

 I'm Ned Stark's son.

123
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:10,444
             Your father was
             an honorable man.

124
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:12,380
 He was, Your Grace.

125
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:14,332
       What do you think
       he'd have done with him?

126
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,374
 I was this man's
 prisoner once.

127
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,544
 He could have tortured me.
 He could have killed me.

128
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,664
 But he spared my life.

129
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:31,966
 I think my father would
 have taken him prisoner,

130
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:33,751
 listened to
 what he had to say.

131
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,824
               Very well, then.
               Take him.

00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,182
     Your Grace.

00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:50,902
 If my father had seen
 the things that I've seen,

134
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:54,872
 he'd also tell you to
 burn the dead

    It is.
    The Death's Head manticore.

142
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:22,850
   I've read
   a great deal about it.
   It's a horrible poison.

              Oh!

00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:28,873
 There's nothing to be done.

146
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:30,141
      Yes, there is.

147

   May I ask what you
   think you're doing?

148
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:35,914
                 Saving him.

    were otherwise,

150
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,902
      but Ser Gregor
      is beyond saving.

           That's for the best.
           No maester knows
           how to save him.

154
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:53,014
          That is exactly
          the sort of arrogance

155
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,917
  that had him expelled
  from the Citadel, Your Grace.

156
00:13:55,985 --> 00:14:00,287
 His curiosity was deemed
 dangerous and unnatural.

157
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:02,306
 Rightly so, in my opinion.

158
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,391
              You're dismissed,

172
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:39,794
     the process may change him

00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:42,263
              somewhat.

174

00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:25,723
             And you will

  When you were nine years old,
  I was called to the capital.

           I decided to take
           your brother with me
           and not you.

194
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,625

 I'm not interested
 in hearing

00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,634
 another one of
 your smug stories
 about the time you won.

 This isn't going to
 be one of those times.

199
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:13,671
            Do you think you'll
            be the first person

200
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,774
            dragged into a Sept
            to be married
            against her will?

201
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,676
           When you marched
           into the throne room
           to tell me

202
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:23,414
      we'd won
      the Battle of Blackwater,
      do you remember?

203
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,584
               I was sitting on
               the Iron Throne
               with Tommen.

204
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:28,168
        I was about to give him
        essence of nightshade.

205
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,737
              That's how far I
              was willing to go

206
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:32,673
  when I thought someone awful
  had come to take my son away.

207
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,562
       Someone awful is
       coming to take him away.

208
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,413
         No.

00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:43,801
            And now you
            want to ship me off
            to Highgarden

211
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,986
              and steal my boy.

212
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:47,721
                   My last boy.

213
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,591
    Margaery will
    dig her claws in,
    you will dig your claws in,

214
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:54,228
       and you'll fight
       over him like beasts
       until you rip him apart.

215
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:58,349
      I will burn our
      house to the ground
      before I let that happen.

216
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,334
 And how will you do that?

217
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,870
             I'll tell everyone
             the truth.

218
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,240
 What truth
 would that be?

219
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,146
        You don't know, do you?

220
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,652
         You never believed it.

221
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,802
          How is that possible?

222
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,375
       What am I saying?
       Of course it's possible.

223
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,829
    How can someone so consumed
    by the idea of his family

224
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:32,300
            have any conception
            what his actual
            family was doing?

225
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:35,252
         We were right
         there in front of you,
         and you didn't see us.

226
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,538
              One real look in
              the past 20 years

227
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:40,307
      at your own children
      and you would have known.

228
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,893
      Known what?

229
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,345
            Everything they say
            is true

230
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:46,997
            about Jaime and me.
       No.

231
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,783
          Your legacy is a lie.
 No, no, no, no.

232
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,903
 I don't believe you.

233
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,542
               Yes, you do.

234
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,426
                 CERSEI: Jaime.

235
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,013
          You won.

236
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,800
 One fewer brother.
 Must be proud of yourself.

237
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,086
 There's really nothing
 you wouldn't do, is there?

238
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,021
             For my family,
             no, nothing.

239
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,156
          I would do
          things for my family
          you couldn't imagine.

240
00:18:29,225 --> 00:18:31,826
 Tyrion is your family.
                 He's not.

241
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:33,160
 You don't get to choose.

242
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,911
              I do. So do you.

243
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,447
              You can choose
              the creature that

244
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,915
        killed our mother to
        come into this world...

245
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,500
 Are you really mad enough
 to blame him for that?

246
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,170
 He didn't
 decide to kill her.
 He was an infant.

247
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:45,072
            A disease doesn't
            decide to kill you.

248
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,175
         All the same, you cut
         it out before it does.

249
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:50,211
            What do you decide?

250
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,379
       What do you choose?

251
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:52,512
 The things I did
 to get back to you,

252
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:55,049
 to endure all that,
 only to find you...

253
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,121
                  I choose you.

254
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:02,406
 Those are words.
                      Yes.

255
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,141
           Like the ones I
           just said to Father.

256
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,161
                    I told him.

257
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,979
 Told him what?

258
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,815
           I told him about us.

259
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:13,700
 You told him?

260
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:15,969
            I told him I won't
            marry Loras Tyrell.

261
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:19,607
         I told him I'm
         staying right here
         with Tommen, with you.

00:58:20,981 --> 00:58:22,381
                 Oh, Tyrion.

659
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:24,733
        Put down that crossbow.

660
00:58:24,785 --> 00:58:26,034
     I murdered her.

661
00:58:28,572 --> 00:58:30,188
 With my own hands.

662
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:34,926
            It doesn't matter.

663
00:58:34,995 --> 00:58:37,062
  Doesn't matter?

664
00:58:37,131 --> 00:58:38,163
              She was a whore.

665
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:42,867
 Say that word again...
                      And what?

666
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,337
           You'll kill your own
           father in the privy?

667
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,006
                     No.

668
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:50,041
                You're my son.

669
00:58:50,977 --> 00:58:52,610
                 Now, enough of
                 this nonsense.

670
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:56,181
   I am your son,
   and you sentenced
   me to die.

671
00:58:56,249 --> 00:58:59,785
 You knew I
 didn't poison Joffrey,

672
00:58:59,853 --> 00:59:03,105
 but you sentenced
 me all the same.

673
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,423
      Why?
                     Enough.

674
00:59:05,492 --> 00:59:08,276
   We'll go back to my chambers
   and speak with some dignity.

675
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,996
 I can't go back there.
 She's in there.

676
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:12,113
              You're afraid of
              a dead whore?

677
00:59:14,485 --> 00:59:16,218
                 (GROANS)

678
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,844
            You shot me.

679
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,169
                (GROANS)

680
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:38,206
        You're no son of mine.

681
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:39,524
      I am your son.

682
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:43,662
      I have always
      been your son.

683
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,796
             (GROANS)

684
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,461
 What have you done?

685
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,632
 Quickly.

686
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:10,071
 Trust me, my friend.
 I've brought you this far.

687
01:00:40,154 --> 01:00:42,387
        (BELLS TOLLING)

688
01:02:05,038 --> 01:02:06,671
          I want to see
          the captain.

689
01:02:06,739 --> 01:02:08,473
 You're seeing him.

690
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:10,675
         I want to go north,
         to the Wall.

691
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:13,128
    No, you don't.

692
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,563
          I can pay.

693
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:18,566
  There is nothing in the North
  but ice and war and pirates.

694
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:21,836
 I wouldn't need a cabin.
 Please.

695
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,572
        I could work
        scrubbing the floors...

696
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,441
 I'm not going north, child.
 I'm going home.

697
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:29,360
                  Where's home?
  The Free City
  of Braavos.

698
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,247
                Wait. I have
                something else.

699
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:34,115
 More silver won't
 make a difference.

700
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:35,917
               It's not silver.

701
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:37,135
                    It's iron.

702
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:41,423
 This...

703
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,179
 How did you...
               Valar Morghulis.

704
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,651
 Valar Dohaeris.

705
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:55,369
 Of course,
 you shall have a cabin.
