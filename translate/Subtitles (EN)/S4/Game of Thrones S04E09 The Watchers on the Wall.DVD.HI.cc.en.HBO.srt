  (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

3
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,879
             What was she like?

4
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,905
 She had red hair.

5
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,508
                        Oh?

6
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,494
         How big were her feet?
 What do you want me to say?

7
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:46,231
          I want you to tell me
          what it was like
          to have someone.

8
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,233
            To be with someone.

9
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,600
   To love someone
   and have them love you back.

10
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:58,426
            We're all gonna die
            a lot sooner
            than I'd planned.

11
00:02:58,495 --> 00:03:01,062
      You're the closest
      I'll ever get to knowing.

12
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,018
 So you and Gilly never?

13
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,553
       No. She just had a baby.

14
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,325
         And she never offered.

15
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,227
 But if she had,

16
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,464
 you would have?

17
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,100
 You'd have broken
 your vows?

18
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,673
      The interesting thing is,

19
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:33,345
    our vows never specifically
    forbid intimate relations
    with women.

20
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,514
       What?

21
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,000
       "I shall take no wife."
       Yes, that's in there.
       There's no denying that.

22
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,402
  "I shall father no children."
  It's very specific.

23
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,456
              But what our vows
              have to say about
              other activities

24
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:46,708
     is open to interpretation.

25
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:52,347
 I don't think Ser Alliser
 cares much for
 interpretation.

26
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,871
                Anyway, there's
                nothing for him
                to interpret.

27
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,506
               We didn't.

28
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,045
             So what's it like?

29
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,248
        It's...

30
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:16,087
 There's this
 whole other person.

31
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,857
 And you're wrapped up in them,
 and they're wrapped up in you.

32
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,092
       And you...

33
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,832
 For a little while,
 you're more than just you.
 You're...

34
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,867
 Well, I don't know.
 I'm not a bleeding poet.

35
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,469
         No, you're really not.

36
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,904
 What did I get for it?

37
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,407
 An arrow six inches
 from my heart.

38
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:39,844
            There'll be arrows
            for all of us soon.

39
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,680
          There will.

40
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,799
          They've already done
          the worst thing to me
          they could ever do.

41
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:50,138
 Go get some sleep, Sam.

42
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,639
 I'll take this watch.

                Did I ever tell
                you about her?

46
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:38,637
       Sheila?

47
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,340
                   Yes.

48
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,908
 That was a night
 to remember.

49
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,594
         Of course,
         I'd had a good
         bit to drink.

           (CHUCKLES)

51
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:51,983
 Her fangs were sharp,
 but she knew how
 to use them.

52
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:56,021
      And she was nice
      and soft down below.

53
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,857
 No, she was no
 ordinary beast.

54
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,458
     Many is the man who...

55
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,894
 I know you never
 fucked a bear.

56
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,380
 You know you never
 fucked a bear.

57
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,917
 Right now,
 I don't want to think about
 the bear you never fucked.

58
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:11,686
 Right now,
 all I want to
 think about is

59
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:14,305
 each one of these arrows
 finding its way
 into a crow's heart.

60
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:17,959
     We could be
     waiting here a while.

61
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:19,393
                     Good.

62
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,296
     The longer we wait,
     the more arrows I'll have.

63
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:22,630
        (OWL SCREECHING)

64
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:29,337
              They came up here
              to our land

65
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:31,906
        and put up a big wall
        and said it was theirs.

66
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,175
              Then they started
              hunting us down.

67
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,197
             But this time,
             we're the ones
             doing the hunting.

68
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,918
            You've got a lot to
            say about killing.

69
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,820
            Even more words
            than arrows.

70
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:50,992
    Back in those villages,
    I killed just as
    many of them as you did.

71
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,794
        More, I reckon.

72
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:56,664
     Yes, but none of those
     were your crow lover.

73
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,583

 him already.

     STYR: So you've said.

75
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,470
       And if not,

76
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,272
 the only thing left
 of him is gonna be

77
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,973
 his fun bits
 hanging around me neck.

78
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:07,876
       STYR: More words.

79
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:10,579
     Know what I think you
     do when you see him?

80
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:14,115
     Serve him up
     a nice juicy
     slice of ginger minge.

00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,451
         (MEN LAUGHING)

82
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,121
     What,
     you've been thinking about
     that ginger minge?

83
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,375
                Wondering what
                it tastes like?

84
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,580
      Maybe I have.

85
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,483
              Jon Snow is mine.

86
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,887
              Anyone else tries
              to kill him,

87
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,290
             I'll have an arrow
             for them.

88
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,929
     And not one of
     your bald friends
     is fast enough to stop me.

89
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,855
          And what is it
          that couldn't wait
          until morning, Tarly?

90
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,274
         Maester Aemon.

91
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:14,642
 How did you know...

92
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:15,743
               That it was you?

93
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:18,196
                  Who else but
                  Samwell Tarly

94
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,932
       would be wasting candles
       to read in the middle
       of the night?

95
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,039
               Let me help you.

96
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,206
 Oh, no need.

97
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,577
 I know my way
 around this library

98
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,547
 better than any other
 place in Castle Black.

99
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:39,918
 Thousands of books
 and no eyes to read them.

100
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:44,088
 Old age is
 a wonderful source
 of ironies,

101
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,357
 if nothing else.

102
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,909
 But you didn't
 answer my question.

103
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:49,977
 What are you reading?

104
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,564
                 Maester Faull.

105
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,932
            Ah.

106
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,667
 The wildlings.

107
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:59,437
 I can assure you that
 the closest Maester Faull

108
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,624
 ever got to a wildling
 was this very library.

109
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,994
            But what he says
            about what they do,

110
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:08,129
                 it's all true.

111
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:10,982
            It's exactly what
            the survivors of
            their raids report.

112
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:15,420
 Yes, imagine the stories
 wildlings tell about us.

113
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:21,125
 Love is the death of duty.

114
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,278
 I told that to your
 friend Jon Snow once.

115
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:28,482
 He didn't listen,
 and neither did you.

116
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:32,453
 Which is why you've abandoned
 your watch atop the Wall

117
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:36,123
 to come here and read
 about the terrible things

118
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:40,495
 that may have happened
 to the girl you love.

119
00:09:40,564 --> 00:09:43,231
              I don't love her.

120
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:45,099
       Yes, you do.
                        No.

121
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,285
        Yes, you do.

122
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:51,072
 Heard it in your voice
 when you first
 brought her to me.

123
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:53,574
 I remember how it sounds.

124
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:55,560
 I was in love once.

125
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,627
                   You were?

126
00:09:57,714 --> 00:10:00,782
 You can imagine
 all manner of horrors

127
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,851
 befalling that poor
 girl and her child.

128
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,453
 Is it so difficult
 to imagine that

129
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,992
 an old person was once,
 more or less, like you?

130
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:12,626
            I'm sorry, Maester.

131
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,429
               I didn't mean it
               like that.

132
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:19,533
 Do you know who I
 was before I came here?

133
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:22,870
 What I could have been
 if I'd only said the word?

134
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,491
 Of course you do.

135
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,128
 I met many girls
 when I was Aemon Targaryen.

136
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,964
 A future king always does.

137
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,702
 Some of them

            They held the gate.

554
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,922
         Get some brothers
         down here to help you.

555
00:47:42,176 --> 00:47:44,042
    We need to burn the bodies.

556
00:48:05,533 --> 00:48:08,099
          Raise the outer gate.

557
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:10,569
            Then lower it again
            as soon as I'm out.

558
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,214
        (METAL CLINKING)

559
00:48:22,282 --> 00:48:23,666
           What are you doing?

560
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,168
       I promised Mormont
       I'd never lose it again.

561
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,708
 In case I don't come back.

562
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,368
      Jon.

563
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:48,807
             Come back.
