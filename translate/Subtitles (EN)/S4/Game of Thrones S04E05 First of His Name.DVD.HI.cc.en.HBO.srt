1
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,684
              HIGH SEPTON:
              May the Warrior
              grant him courage

2
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,720
          and protect him in
          these perilous times.

3
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,922
             May the Smith
             grant him strength

4
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,358
           that he might bear
           this heavy burden.

5
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,127
         And may the Crone,

6
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,929
      she that knows
      the fate of all men,

7
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,232
     show him the path
     he must walk

8
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,202
 and guide him
 through the dark places
 that lie ahead.

9
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,570
 In the light of the Seven,

10
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,639
  I now proclaim Tommen
  of the House Baratheon,

11
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,275
        First of His Name,

12
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,677
         King of the Andals
         and the First Men

13
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:28,380
         and Lord of
         the Seven Kingdoms.

14
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,485
             Long may he reign!

15
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,804
    ALL: Long may he reign!

16
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:38,040
           (CHEERING)

17
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,733
            Special day.

18
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,643
        (CROWD CHATTING)

19
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:07,936
                   Your Grace.

20
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,673
                   Your Grace.

21
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,866
             CROWD: Your Grace.

22
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,166
  Your Grace.

23
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,071
         There he is.

24
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,807
 Long may he reign.

25
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,342
        Long may he reign.

26
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:11,149
 He sits the throne
 like he was born to it.

27
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:14,419
        Yes. He wasn't,
        though, was he?

28
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:16,922
 No, he wasn't.

29
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,264
         You still mourn
         for Joffrey?

30
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,266
 He was my husband.
 My king.

31
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,433
        He would have been
        your nightmare.

32
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:35,557
            Your Grace,
            I feel...

33
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:37,559
               You knew exactly
               what he was.

34
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:40,461
                    I did, too.

35
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,963
          You never love
          anything in the world

36
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,398
             the way you love
             your first child.

37
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,502
              Doesn't matter
              what they do.

38
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,842
              And what he did,
              it shocked me.

39
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:58,512
            Do you think
            I'm easily shocked?

40
00:04:58,581 --> 00:04:59,781
       No.

41
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,234
              The things he did
              shocked me.

42
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,076
               He's only a boy.

43
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,029
 A good, decent boy.
 He always has been.

44
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,468
 Who was the last
 decent king, I wonder?

45
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,285
      He could be the first man
      who sits on that throne

46
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,989
        in 50 years
        to actually deserve it.

47
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,793
 It would be some consolation,
 wouldn't it?

48
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,128
     For all the horror
     that put him there.

49
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,904
           He will need help

50
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,940
             if he's going
             to rule well.

51
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,009
   He has you.

52
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,326
        A mother is not enough.

53
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:51,449
        You're still interested
        in being queen?

54
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,151
         (SCOFFS)

55
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,920
 After all that's happened?

56
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:01,309
 It sounds strange,
 but I am...

57
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:03,879
 I haven't even
 given any thought to it,

58
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,447
      what comes next.

59
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,883
 It would be a great
 honor, of course.

60
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,087
       But I will have to speak
       to my father about it.

61
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,090
 Yes, speak to your father.

62
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,227
            I'll speak to mine.

63
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:28,302
 We may be faced
 with an alarming number
 of weddings soon.

64
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,388
 (CHUCKLES)

65
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,789
 I won't even know
 what to call you.

66
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,608
    Sister?

67
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:37,712
        Or Mother?

68
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:39,381
         (CHUCKLES)

69
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,735
 JORAH: King Joffrey
 Baratheon is dead.

70
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:47,822
 Murdered at his own wedding.

71
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:50,809
     BARRISTAN: And we've taken
     the Meereenese navy,
     Your Grace.

72
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:52,894
                The Second Sons
                took the navy.

73
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,946
             Who told you to?

74
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:57,098
                       No one.

75
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,817
 So why did you do it?

76
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,753
               I heard
               you liked ships.

77
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,342
          How many ships?

78
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,743
                93, Your Grace.

79
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,328
 How many men
 can they carry?

80
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,898
          9,300,
          not counting sailors.

81
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,317
 Would that be enough
 to take King's Landing?

82
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:17,018
   The Lannisters have more.

83
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,370
 BARRISTAN:
 They've been fighting
 Joffrey's wars for years.

84
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,256
      They're tired, dispersed.

85
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:23,475
 And now their
 king is dead.

86
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,394
              8,000 Unsullied,
              2,000 Second Sons

87
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,848
 sailing into
 Blackwater Bay

88
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,484
 and storming the gates
 without warning.

89
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:38,272
  It's hard to say.
  It could be enough.

90
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:41,526
 But we're not fighting
 to make you queen
 of King's Landing.

91
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:44,595
   10,000 men can't
   conquer Westeros.

92
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,397
      BARRISTAN: The old houses
      will flock to our queen

93
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,932
               when she crosses
               the Narrow Sea.

94
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,234
 JORAH: The old houses
 will flock to

95
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,701
   whichever side
   they think will win,

96
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,771
  as they always have.

97
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,375
 There's other news.

98
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,277
   From Yunkai.

99
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,263
 Without the Unsullied
 to enforce your rule,

100
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:05,483
 the Wise Masters
 have retaken control
 of the city.

101
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:08,286
 They've reenslaved
 the freedmen
 who stayed behind

102
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,722
 and sworn to take
 revenge against you.

103
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,125
 And in Astapor,

104
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,694
 the council you installed
 to rule over the city

105
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,864
 has been overthrown
 by a butcher named Cleon

106
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,067
 who's declared
 himself "His
 Imperial Majesty."

107
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,054
               DAENERYS:
               Please leave me.

108
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,295
                Not you, Jorah.

109
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,179
       It appears my liberation
       of Slaver's Bay isn't
       going quite as planned.

110
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:57,285
 You could sail for Westeros
 and leave it all behind.

111
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:59,220
   A boy sits
   on the Iron Throne.

112
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,408
   A boy many believe
   to be a bastard
   with no right to it.

113
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,844
 They've never been
 more vulnerable.

114
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,629
            You counselled me
            against rashness
            once in Qarth.

115
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,966
               I didn't listen.

116
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:13,367
      That all worked out well.

117
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:15,437
     (CHUCKLES)

118
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,394
                How can I rule
                seven kingdoms

119
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,997
             if I can't control
             Slaver's Bay?

120
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,868
               Why should
               anyone trust me,

121
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,537
                 follow me?

122
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,072
 You're a Targaryen,

123
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,340
 the Mother of Dragons.

124
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,411
               I need to be
               more than that.

125
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:52,590
        I will not let
        those I have freed
        slide back into chains.

126
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,792
              I will not sail
              for Westeros.

127
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,728
       What, then?

128
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,397
              I will do
              what queens do.

129
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:06,053
              I will rule.

130
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,291
   Pull up your hood.

131
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,495
 A memorable shade.

132
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,598
          But how would
          they know?

133
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:54,335
 You know what kind of stories
 poor men enjoy the most?

134
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,138
 Ones about rich girls
 they'll never meet.

135
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,928
           Is this the only way
           into the Eyrie?

136
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,231
          The mountains
          are impassable.

137
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,432
        If you want to
        get to the Eyrie,

138
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,517
    you need to go through
    the Bloody Gate.

139
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,088
        It doesn't matter
        how large your army is,

140
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:15,957
  if you attack this gate,
  you do it on this road,

141
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,925
      three men abreast,

142
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:21,762
    and get slaughtered
    like goats.

143
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:23,481
      The first
      Lords of the Vale
      didn't have much,

144
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,385
 but they had these mountains
 and they knew how to use them.

145
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,254
 And the fortress
 they built here
 has never been overcome.

146
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:33,040
 Not once in 1,000 years.

147
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,977
   Know your strengths,
   use them wisely,

148
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:39,147
   and one man can
   be worth 10,000.

149
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,770
     KNIGHT: Who would
     pass the Bloody Gate?

150
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:48,739
  Lord Petyr Baelish
  and his niece Alayne.

151
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,796
                  Stand to.

152
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:57,164
       KNIGHTS: Stand to!

153
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,118
               Welcome back,
               Lord Baelish.

154
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,521
        (GATE CLANKING)

155
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,747
                   (DOOR OPENS)

156
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,534
        Uncle Petyr!

157
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:36,904
         LITTLEFINGER: My lord.

158
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,463
               Oh.

159
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,567
            I have
            brought you a gift.

160
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,356
           Lord Baelish.

161
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:56,524
        My lady.

162
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:58,025
          Look what Uncle Petyr
          brought me.

163
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,695
           A beautiful gift
           for a beautiful boy.

164
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:03,981
    It's a pleasure to
    make your acquaintance,
    Lady Arryn.

165
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,049
           My name is...

166
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,919
            Oh, do take down
            that hood, child.

167
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,572
            Don't you think
            I know who you are?

168
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,525
 You think I'd let
 my intended leave the Eyrie
 on urgent business

169
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:18,395
 without knowing
 what that business was?

170
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:22,366
              I let him go
              so he could bring
              you here to me.

171
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,522
 My flesh and blood.

172
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,477
          It's wonderful to
          meet you, Aunt Lysa.

173
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,712
 You mustn't call me that
 in front of anyone else.

174
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,913
                  I understand.

175
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,548
 No one can know
 you're here.

176
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,884
 It would put us in
 a very precarious position.

177
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,385
                  I would never
                  say a thing.

178
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,654
   The Lannisters
   want to destroy us.

179
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,907
 They've been
 trying for years.

180
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:47,875
            Now they know
            what it feels like.

181
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:49,593
        ROBIN: Mummy said
        they killed your mother

182
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,562
      and they chopped off
      your brother's head.

183
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,051
             They did,
             and my father's.

184
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,788
         They killed my father,
         too, with poison.

185
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:04,091
       I wanted to make
       the little Lannister
       baby man fly, (CHUCKLES)

186
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,976
             but Mother said
             I couldn't.

187
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,811
              Make him fly?

188
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,714
 Through the Moon Door.

189
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,301
       (GIGGLES)

190
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,737
 LYSA: And on top
 of everything else,

191
00:14:16,806 --> 00:14:19,156
  they made you marry
  that filthy troll.

192
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,894
            They made us both.
            Lord Tyrion
            didn't want to.

193
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,162
 LYSA:
 I don't believe that.

194
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,648
 Did he force
 himself on you?

195
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:30,685
               No. We never...
 LYSA: Good.

196
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:33,604
 Robin, this is
 your cousin Sansa.

197
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,623
         But you're not
         to call her Sansa
         in front of anyone

198
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:38,125
          but Uncle Petyr
          and myself.
          Do you understand?

199
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:39,927
 Sansa, this is
 my son Robin.

200
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,497
            It's a pleasure
            to meet you, Robin.

201
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:47,401
 Robin, show Sansa
 to her chamber.
 Take the back stairs.

202
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,640
 Go. We'll speak soon.

203
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:04,017
 What took you so long?

204
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,788
            Arranging for
            the ascension
            of King Tommen I,

205
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:08,956
             extricating Sansa,

206
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,340
        getting her here alive.

207
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:12,259
        She's here.

208
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,562
   We've spent more
   than enough time on her
   for one evening.

209
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,582
 Let's get married tonight.

210
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,285
              Ought we not...

211
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,955
     ...inform the Lords of the
     Vale about the ceremony?

212
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,806
 (HUFFS) There's only
 one Lord of the Vale.

213
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,709
 The others can all hang.

214
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,377
 Lurking and
 simpering on the stairs

215
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:31,946
 like buzzards
 the moment my husband died,

216
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,481
 trying to get
 their claws in me.

217
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,948
            I do think that we
            could wait until...

218
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,385
 I'm done waiting, Petyr.

219
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:40,788
 We had our wedding night
 many years ago.

220
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,356
 Or don't you remember?

221
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:44,692
         Like it was yesterday.

222
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:49,229
 What wife would do for you
 the things I've done?

223
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:52,734
 What wife would trust you
 the way I've trusted you?

224
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:54,869
 When you gave me those drops

225
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:57,438
 and told me to pour
 them into Jon's wine,

226
00:15:57,506 --> 00:15:59,056
 my husband's wine.

227
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:02,242
 When you told me to
 write a letter to Cat

228
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,744
 telling her it was the...

229
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,198
 (LYSA MOANING)

230
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:19,127
              The deed is done.

231
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:21,963
            Faded into nothing.

232
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,298
            Only speaking of it
            can make it real.

233
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:29,453
           Tonight it is, then.

234
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,438
         (LAUGHS)

235
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:35,893
 Let me bathe and dress
 for the occasion.

236
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:39,230
 Once I'm presentable,
 I'll call on
 the Septon immediately.

237
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,007
               I'm warning you.

238
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:53,044
            I'm going to scream
            when my husband
            makes love to me.

239
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:58,900
 So loud they'll hear me
 clear across the Narrow Sea.

        (LYSA SCREAMING)

 TYWIN: When will
 the wedding take place
 in your mind?

245
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,979
         CERSEI: As soon
         as decency permits.

246
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:33,734
     After we've allowed Tommen
     the appropriate time
     to mourn his brother

247
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,469
           and Margaery to
           mourn her husband.

248
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:36,670
    A fortnight?

249
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:38,706
         That seems reasonable.

250
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:42,009
 No jugglers,
 no jousting dwarves,

251
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:44,345
 no 77-course meals.

252
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,749
 And your wedding to Loras?

253
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:51,602
        Shortly after Tommen's.

254
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,788
       Shortly?
                   A fortnight.

255
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:57,624
 I know you don't like them.

256
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:59,793
 I didn't like your husband.

257
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:02,296
  Used to pat me
  on the back a lot.

258
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:03,964
 I didn't trust him.

259
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,666
         We had that in common.

260
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:10,237
 You don't need to
 make formal alliances
 with people you trust.

261
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:13,306
                  Then whom
                  can we trust?

262
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,509
   Ourselves alone.

263
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,531
   The Tyrells

264
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,735
 are our only true rivals
 in terms of resources

265
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,938
      and we need them
      on our side.

266
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,842
             Robert wasn't
             particularly rich.

267
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,995
  Robert had me
  funding him.

268
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:37,031
 Wars swallow gold
 like a pit in the earth.

269
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:40,568
        I suppose that explains
        why we did so well
        in the last one.

270
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:42,286
 Do you know
 how much gold was mined

271
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,338
 in the Westerlands
 this past year?

272
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:45,506
              Haven't a clue.

273
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:47,958
 Your best guess.

274
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,077
          Pounds, tons, ounces?

275
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,379
 Doesn't matter.
 The answer is the same.

276
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,132
                 Can't be.

277
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,169
 Our last working mine
 ran dry three years ago.

278
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,388
             Then how do we pay
             for anything?

279
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:05,592
 The crown owes
 the Iron Bank of Braavos
 a tremendous amount of money.

280
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,145
                     How much?

281
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:12,216
 A tremendous amount.

282
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,719
          There must be someone
          at the Iron Bank
          you can speak to,

283
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,387
                   come to some
                   arrangement.

284
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,373
  The Iron Bank
  is the Iron Bank.
  There is no someone.

285
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:23,010
     Someone does work there.
     It is comprised of people.

286
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,262
 And a temple
 is comprised of stones.

287
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:28,515
  One stone crumbles
  and another
  takes its place.

288
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:33,421
 And the temple holds its form
 for 1,000 years or more.

289
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:36,523
 That's what
 the Iron Bank is,
 a temple.

290
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:41,178
 We all live in its shadow
 and almost none of us know it.

291
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,481
 You can't run from them.
 You can't cheat them.

292
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,750
     You can't sway them
     with excuses.

293
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:50,454
   If you owe them money
   and you don't want
   to crumble yourself,

294
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,106
       you pay it back.

295
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:56,994
 Vesting
 the Tyrells in the crown
 will help a great deal.

296
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,596
            It's for the good
            of the family,
            I understand that.

297
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,335
              I'm not sure
              my brothers do.

298
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:13,477
 I know you're
 building a strong case
 against Tyrion.

299
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,113
 And as a mother,
 that is your right.

300
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:20,851
   But as a judge,
   I cannot discuss
   the trial with you.

301
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
            I respect that.

302
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,190
               We don't need
               to discuss it.

303
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:34,097
           The Lannister legacy
           is the only thing
           that matters.

304
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,550
        You've started wars
        to protect this family.

305
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,070
      Turned your back on Jaime

306
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,955
      for refusing to
      contribute to its future.

307
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,526
       What does Tyrion deserve

308
00:20:45,595 --> 00:20:47,728
           for lighting
           that future on fire?

309
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,974
                 ARYA: Joffrey.

310
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,976
                        Cersei.

311
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:04,278
                   Walder Frey.

312
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,379
                  Meryn Trant.

313
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,082
               Tywin Lannister.

314
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:11,218
                 The Red Woman.

315
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,654
              Beric Dondarrion.

316
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,258
                 Thoros of Myr.

317
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:18,659
                    Ilyn Payne.

318
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:20,944
                  The Mountain.

319
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,180
 Would you shut up?

320
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:26,217
         I can't sleep
         until I say the names.

321
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,754
 The names
 of every fucking
 person in Westeros?

322
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,523
           Only the ones
           I'm going to kill.

323
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,991
     (CHUCKLES)

324
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,161
 Hate's as good
 a thing as any
 to keep a person going.

325
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,196
 Better than most.

326
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,734
 We come across my brother,

327
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,637
 maybe we can both
 cross a name off our list.

328
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,343
             If he were
             here right now,
             what would you do?

329
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,388
 I'd tell him
 to shut the fuck up
 so I can get some sleep.

330
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:12,829
 Go on, get it over with,
 your list of doomed men.

331
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,568
               I'm almost done.

332
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,637
            Only one name left.

333
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,139
      Go on.

334
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,782
  The Hound.

335
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,424
              SANSA: Thank you.

336
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:42,342
     Your mother always
     had a sweet tooth.

337
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:43,977
                        Really?
          Oh, yes.

338
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:47,147
 At suppertime,
 she would go straight
 for honey cakes,

339
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:48,899
      candied almonds, custard.

340
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,101
           Anything sweet.

341
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,838
   Eventually, your grandfather
   had to assign a septa
   to watch her at meals.

342
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,374
        Cat was the firstborn
        daughter after all.

343
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,009
 It was important that
 she remain desirable

344
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,645
 so Father could arrange
 a good match for her

345
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,314
 and she was
 starting to get fat.

346
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,984
                 My mother fat?

347
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,385
     (BOTH CHUCKLE LIGHTLY)

348
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,388
              She never let me
              have my pudding

349
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,457
            until I'd finished
            all my proper food.

350
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,627
 This is before she
 married your father
 and moved to the North.

351
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:20,196
 By the time you were born,
 your father's austerity
 had become hers.

352
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,166
 Marriage changes people.

353
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:26,537
    (GASPS)

354
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:29,940
 I didn't mean
 for you to stop.
 Enjoy them.

355
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,980
 How do you like them?

356
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:37,998
             They're delicious.

357
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:43,470
  Where did you get the lemons?
  You can't grow them up here.

358
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:45,305
        Oh, gods, no.

359
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:48,408
  Petyr had three crates
  brought all the way
  from King's Landing.

360
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:50,544
      He knew you liked
      lemon cakes.

361
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:51,912
                  He's so kind.

362
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:54,781
          He really
          cares for you.

363
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,750
 Think where you'd be
 without him.

364
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:59,119
  In their clutches,
  on trial for murder.

365
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,540
           Yes. I'm very lucky.

366
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,142
 He feels
 responsible for you.

367
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,510
            Oh, I know he does.
            I'm so grateful.

368
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:07,911
       Why?

369
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:11,198
    Why does he feel
    responsible for you?

370
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,986
          Well, I'm half Tully.
          He loved your family
          so much.

371
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,154
 Loved your mother.
                      No.

372
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,756
     That's what
     you wanted to say.

373
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,774
       He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
       He's married to you.

374
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,776
      Your mother
      never loved him.

375
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:25,545
 Cat always went straight
 for the sweetest thing.

376
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:28,615
   The most obvious thing.
   Your Uncle Brandon.

377
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:31,952
 Your handsome, arrogant,
 cruel Uncle Brandon.

378
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:34,204
     He almost killed
     Petyr in a duel.

379
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,439
 And your mother
 loved him anyway.

380
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:40,310
 And now Petyr
 is risking his life
 to save you,

381
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,846
 the daughter of a woman
 who didn't love him.

382
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:46,083
 No more than those
 whores in his brothels.

383
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,785
 Has he told you
 about them?

384
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,486
                        No.

385
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,655
 He hasn't told you
 about the vile things
 they do with their bodies,

386
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,041
 they let him
 do with their bodies?

387
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:55,860
                         Never.
    Are you pregnant?

388
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:59,379
          What? No, I told you.

389
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:00,547
     Lord Tyrion and I never...

390
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:02,482
 I wasn't asking
 about Tyrion.

391
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,418
 What have you let
 Petyr do with your body?

392
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:05,852
            Aunt Lysa, no, I...

393
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,170
 Your young, pretty body.

394
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,605
         Nothing. I'm a virgin.

395
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,107
 Don't lie to me.

396
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,391
             You're hurting me.

397
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,744
 I'll know if you lie.

398
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,381
      I'm a virgin, I swear it.

399
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,249
       He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

400
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,185
              All he says is
              that I'm stupid.

401
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,419
       I'm a stupid little girl

402
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,388
             with stupid dreams
             who never learns,

403
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,455
       and I'm a terrible liar,

404
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,990
            so I should always
            tell the truth.

405
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,942
       And I swear to you that
       he has never touched me.

      how to ride a horse?

 Yes, my lady,
 when I was young.

419
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,624
           There wasn't much
           call for it with
           Lord Tyrion, though.

420
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:20,327
         He preferred litters.

421
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:22,896
      Perhaps you should
      have stayed with him.

00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:47,654
            Never, my lady.
            I'm your squire.

 You really believe
 Tyrion murdered your son?

513
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,687
               I know he did.

514

   We will have a trial
   and we will
   learn the truth.

00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,894
            We'll have a trial,
            anyway.

516
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:01,251
                I haven't seen
                my daughter
                in over a year.

517

 OBERYN:
 The last time I saw her,

518
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,656
 she was swimming
 with two of my girls
 in the Water Gardens.

519
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:10,443
 Laughing in the sun.

520
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:14,414
   I want to believe that.

521
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,416
       I want to believe
       she's happy.

   You have my word.

523
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,721
 We don't hurt
 little girls in Dorne.

   Everywhere in the world,
   they hurt little girls.

525
00:32:36,138 --> 00:32:39,472
     Would you bring her
     a gift for me?

526
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,591
               I wasn't there
               for her nameday.

527
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,576
     I don't know when
     I'll see her again.

528
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,962
 Anything at all.

529
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,415
 The best shipwrights
 in King's Landing

530
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:51,484
 have been working
 on it for months.

531
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,672
        Myrcella loves
        the open water.

532

 I will have it sailed down
 to Sunspear for her.
