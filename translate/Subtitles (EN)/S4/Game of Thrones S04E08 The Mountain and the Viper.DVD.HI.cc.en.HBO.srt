 Mmm. Strong, as long
 as they're in the sea.

147

    When you take them
    out of the water,
    no bones.

148
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:47,581
 They collapse under
 their proud weight

149
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,251
 and slump into
 a heap of nothing.

150
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,353
 You'd think they'd know that.

151
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:55,089
 Unfortunately,
 they're not very bright.

152

      What do you tell them?

153
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:00,928
             I'm Theon Greyjoy,

 Are you sure?

     You do look

           with a Bolton army?

186
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,357
 Lord Bolton took me
 captive after Winterfell.

187

 He sent me to treat
 with you in good faith

 You are fading from sickness,

 you are badly outnumbered,
 and you're hundreds
 of miles from the sea.

 Lord Bolton implores you
 to protect your men

  and abandon this fortress
  you can no longer hold.

00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:36,316
      I'll tell you everything.

286
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:40,187
          Please, Alayne,
          leave nothing out.

287
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,325
       My name is not Alayne.

288
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:47,111
           It's Sansa Stark,

289
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,230
 eldest daughter of
 Lord Eddard Stark.

290
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,917
      Lord Royce,
      we met when you
      came to Winterfell.

291
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:56,120
        You were escorting
        your son Ser Waymar
        to the Wall.

292
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,123
       Sansa Stark?

293
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,242
 You tell lies right
 to my face, you little worm?

294
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:05,178
       Lord Baelish has told
       many lies.

295
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,033
        All to protect me.

296
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,337
  Since my father was executed,

297
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:16,907
   I have been
   a hostage in King's Landing.

298
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:21,328
    A plaything for
    Joffrey to torture
    or Queen Cersei to torment.

299
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:24,114
          They beat me,
          they humiliated me,

300
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:27,485
    they married me to the Imp.

301
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,520
           I had no friends
           in King's Landing,

302
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:33,774
               except one.

303
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:42,282
 He saved me.

304
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:45,636
 Smuggled me away
 when he had the chance.

305
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,489
         He knew I'd be
         safe here in the Eyrie

306
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,393
             with my own blood,
             my Aunt Lysa.

307
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:56,513
       But the Lannisters
       have friends everywhere.

308
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,315
                 Even the Vale.

309
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,468
           He made me swear
           not to tell
           anyone my true name.

310
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:03,537
         Your secret is
         safe with us, my lady.

311
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:06,440
 ROYCE: Your father grew up
 right here in these halls.

312
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:08,625
 We hunted together many times.

313
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,244
 He was a fine man.

314
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:14,130
       Tell us what happened
       to your aunt, Sansa.

315
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:20,587
 You knew her well,
 my lords, my lady.

316
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:22,739
 She was a troubled woman.

317
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:26,626
 She always loved Lord Baelish.
 She told me herself.

318
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:29,462
 From the moment he arrived
 at the gates of Riverrun,

319
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:34,234
 a boy of eight
 carrying everything he owned
 in a little sack.

320
00:22:34,303 --> 00:22:38,538
    She confessed to me
    she never loved Lord Arryn.

321
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,709
 She did
 as her father commanded,
 as so many of us have.

322
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,196
 When the gods
 finally allowed her
 to be with Lord Baelish,

323
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:49,132
  she was so happy. For a time.

324
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:54,838
    My aunt was a jealous lady.

325
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:59,577
       She was terrified
       that Lord Baelish
       didn't love her anymore.

326
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,546
      That he would abandon her
      for a younger woman.

327
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,985
                  And then,

328
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,172
   one day she saw him kiss me.

329
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,423
       Lady Sansa.

330
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:16,376
    It was a peck on the cheek,
    Lord Royce, nothing more.

331
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:20,648
     Lord Baelish is
     my uncle now, by marriage.

332
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:22,616
  He's always
  been so kind to me.

333
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:25,736
 I was so happy to
 be here, to be free.

334
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:26,870
 All because of him.

335
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:29,990
 But my aunt turned on me.

336
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:33,143
             She cursed me.
             Called me a whore.

337
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:36,447
         Promised to throw me
         through the Moon Door.

338
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:40,551
             When Lord Baelish
             tried to calm her,
             she struck him.

339
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,835
          She said she didn't
          want to live anymore.

340
00:23:41,904 --> 00:23:44,004
          She stood on the edge
          of that Moon Door.

341
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:45,906
   He tried to reason with her,

342
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:49,442
           promised her
           she was the only one
           he had ever loved,

343
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,063
            but she stepped
            through those doors
            and she was...

344
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,535
                  (SHUSHING)

345
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,305
 It's not your fault,
 sweet girl.

346
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:09,230
     It's not your fault.

347
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,680
 ROYCE:
 You could see it in the way
 she raised that boy.

348
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:29,683
 Feeding him from her own teats
 when he was 10 years old.

349
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:32,753
       Lord Royce!
       This is hardly the time.

350
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:34,788
 Apologies, my lady.

351
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:38,158
 And to you as well, Baelish.
 We treated you a bit harshly.

352
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:42,029
  You want justice, Lord Royce.
  I can hardly complain
  about that.

353
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:44,047
        I want the same.

354
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:48,051
   ANYA: Not much justice to be
   meted out in suicide,
   is there?

355
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,520
 For Lysa, no.
 But for her son?

356
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,690
   Only 20 years ago,
   the knights of the Vale

357
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:56,176
   rode behind Jon Arryn,
   Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

358
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,696
      They fought together
      to overcome the Mad King.

359
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:03,033
            And since then,
            Arryn and Royce,
            Corbray, Waynwood,

360
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:06,220
         all the great houses
         of the Vale watched
         from the corner.

361
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:08,722
     A timid boy
     at a tavern brawl.

362
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,391
          Are you questioning
          our courage?

363
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,011
 I want to know
 which side you're on.

364
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,963
 Do you support the Lannisters,
 the house that executed
 your friend Ned Stark?

365
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:19,750
     Of course we don't support
     the damn Lannisters.

366
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:22,936
 No? Catelyn Stark
 begged her sister
 for support, and Lysa refused.

367
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,538
 By staying out of the fray,

368
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:29,242
 you've allowed Tywin Lannister
 to destroy his rivals
 on every compass point.

369
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:30,777
 Who stands against him now?

370
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:33,414
 Who would you have us back,
 Lord Baelish?

371
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,266
    Robb Stark is dead.

372
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,834
 I'd have you back Robin Arryn,

373
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,286
 Lord of the Vale.

374
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:41,621
   Robin Arryn is
   a sickly little boy.

375
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,008
 And sickly little boys
 sometimes become powerful men.

376
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,060
    More often they die young.

377
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,696
 I adored Lysa
 with all my heart,

378
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:53,867
 but she loved her son so much
 she became overprotective.

379
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:57,604
 He needs to learn
 how to swing a sword,
 how to ride a horse.

380
00:25:57,673 --> 00:25:59,422
                Aye, it's time.

381
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,158
     Yes.

382
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:05,295
 Time for him to tour the Vale,
 to visit all the castles
 in his domain.

383
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:08,632
 Time for Robin
 to leave the nest.

384
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:19,792
            (GRUNTING)

385
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,220
 BOY: Ser Barristan.

386
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,672
                       Yes?

387
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,024
                  Who sent you?

388
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,045
                Ser Barristan.

389
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:13,063
     Ser Jorah.

390
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,599
             Have I forgotten
             a council meeting?

391
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,484
        No.

392
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,695
                 What's this?

393
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:31,898
 A royal pardon signed
 by Robert Baratheon.

394
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:48,565
 You spied on her.

395
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,252
             Who gave you this?

396
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:54,321
      Does it matter?

397
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,082
             Have you told her?

398
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:08,469
 I wanted to tell
 you first, man-to-man,

399
00:28:08,537 --> 00:28:10,671
 rather than go
 behind your back.

400
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:15,625
           Let me speak
           with her in private.

401
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,844
 You'll never be
 alone with her again.

402
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,000
 Why did the usurper
 pardon you?

403
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:01,688
       If we could speak alone.

404
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:04,858
 No, speak to me here.

405
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:06,810
 Explain it to me.

406
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:10,730
          Who do you think
          sent this to Meereen?
          Who profits?

407
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,167
            This is the work
            of Tywin Lannister.

408
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:15,135
         He wants to divide us.

409
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:17,654
  If we're fighting each other,
  we're not fighting him.

410
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:20,591
 The pardon was signed
 the year we met.

411
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:23,710
 Why were you pardoned?

412
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:26,096
 Unless you're saying
 this document was forged.

413
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,733
              It is not forged.

414
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:32,635
 Why, then?

415
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,388
       I sent letters to Varys,

416
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:37,373
               the spymaster of
               King's Landing.

417
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,609
 What was the content
 of these letters?

418
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:42,246
                 Information.
 What information?

419
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,249
           When you and Viserys
           arrived in Pentos.

420
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,317
             His plan to marry
             you to Khal Drogo.

421
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,319
         When you were married.

422
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,471
        When your brother died.

423
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,157
 You told him I was
 carrying Drogo's child?

424
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,492
                    I...
       Yes or no?

425
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,726
                      Khaleesi.
 Don't call me that.

426
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,796
 Did you tell him I was
 carrying Drogo's child?

427
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:03,967
                    Yes.

428
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,524
 That wine merchant
 tried to poison me
 because of your information.

429
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:12,292
             I stopped you from
             drinking his wine.

430
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,444
       Because you knew
       it was poisoned.

431
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,630
             I suspected.

432
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,415
         You betrayed me

433
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,351
        from the first.

434
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,220
            Forgive me.

435
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,621
             I never meant...

436
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:28,458
  Please, Khaleesi, forgive me.

437
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,578
 You sold my secrets to
 the man who killed my father

438
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:33,746
 and stole
 my brother's throne...
          I have protected you,

                killed for you.

440
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,466
 ...and you want
 me to forgive you?

441
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,520
            I have loved you.

442
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,207

443
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,892
 Love?
 How can you say that to me?

444
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:48,512
 Any other man,
 and I would have you executed.

445
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:52,215
 But you,
 I do not want you
 in my city dead or alive.

446
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:55,035
 Go back to your masters
 in King's Landing.

447
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:57,004
  Collect your pardon,
  if you can.

              Daenerys, please.

 Don't ever presume
 to touch me again
 or speak my name.

450
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:10,400
 You have until dusk
 to collect your things
 and leave this city.

451
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:13,586
 If you're found in Meereen
 past break of day,

452
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:16,106
 I'll have your head
 thrown into Slaver's Bay.

453
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,727
            Go.

454
00:31:22,197 --> 00:31:23,763

                  Walk with me.

00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,283
           Has there been
           any word from Locke?

459

                  No.

     None of the northern lords
     have seen them.

00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,461
              Dead most likely.

463
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,399
           Most of the ironborn
           have fled the North.

464
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:53,269
          Now more will follow,
          thanks to you.

465
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,573
          Tell me what you see.

         Tell me what you see.

468

           Nothing.

        Not nothing. The North.

470

            300 miles that way.

473
00:33:25,987 --> 00:33:29,639
         The North is larger
         than the other
         six kingdoms combined.

474
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,075

     Ramsay Snow.

00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,003
         First time I saw you,

 You're not a child any longer.

495
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,098
 Why did you help me?

496
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:40,419
 They would have thrown you
 through the Moon Door
 if they found you guilty.

497
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:42,856
          That's not an answer.

498
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:48,194
 If they'd have executed you,
 what would they
 have done with me?

00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,848
     I don't know.

          been there to watch.

      when he knew it was over.

 Aye, nothing in the world
 beats that look.

 You'd think being

 would have given you
 some affinity
 for the afflicted.

               On the contrary.

            like everyone else.

          Yes, other interests.

00:41:51,526 --> 00:41:53,626

     all those beetles?
     What did he get out of it?

619

   "Orson, why are you smashing
   all those beetles?"

621
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:04,504
          He gave me an answer.

622
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:07,507
            "Smash the beetles.
            Smash 'em."

      I was the smartest person
      I knew.

626
00:42:13,814 --> 00:42:15,781
       Certainly I had
       the wherewithal
       to unravel the mysteries

627
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:18,351
          that lay at
          the heart of a moron.

628
00:42:18,419 --> 00:42:21,154
     So I went to
     Maester Volarik's library.

629
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:23,256
 Volarik.
 Tried to touch me once.

630
00:42:23,324 --> 00:42:25,791
        Turns out, far too much
        has been written
        about great men

631
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,494
           and not nearly
           enough about morons.

632
00:42:28,563 --> 00:42:30,630
            Doesn't seem right.

633
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:32,331
           In any case,
           I found nothing

634
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,534
    that illuminated the nature
    of Orson's affliction

635
00:42:34,602 --> 00:42:37,770
         or the reason behind
         his relentless
         beetle slaughter.

636
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,006
  So I went back to the source.

637
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:41,941
      I may not have been
      able to speak with Orson,

638
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,727
       but I could observe him,
       watch him

639
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:46,930
      the way men watch animals

640
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:49,766
         to come to
         a deeper understanding
         of their behavior.

641
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,436
            And as I watched,

642
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,039
         I became more and more
         sure of it.

643
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,642
     There was
     something happening there.

644
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,411
             His face was like
             the page of a book

645
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,497

          I didn't understand.

646
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:07,750
        But he wasn't mindless.
        He had his reasons.

647
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:10,686
   And I became possessed
   with knowing what they were.

648
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,422
          I began to spend
          inordinate amounts
          of time watching him.

649
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,426
           I would eat my lunch
           in the garden,

      wasn't watching him,
      I was thinking about him.

       about the family legacy,

654
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,337

         about Orson's beetles.

        I read the histories
        of Targaryen conquests.

           And I still
           couldn't figure out
           why he was doing it.

660
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,369
        And I had to know,
        because it was horrible

661
00:43:43,437 --> 00:43:45,704
           that all these

675
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:24,576
          He just pushed me
          aside with a "cuhn"
          and kept on smashing.
