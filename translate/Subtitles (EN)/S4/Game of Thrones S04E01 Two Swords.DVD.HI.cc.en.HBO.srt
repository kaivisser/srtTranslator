            Looks fresh-forged.

 It is.

     No one's made
     a Valyrian steel sword
     since the Doom of Valyria.

8
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:02,757
 There are three living smiths
 who know how to rework
 Valyrian steel.

9
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,827
 The finest of them
 was in Volantis.

10
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:08,713
 Came here to King's Landing
 at my invitation.

11
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,682
      Where did you get
      this much Valyrian steel?

12
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,068
 From someone who
 no longer had need of it.

15
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,894
 The original weapon
 was absurdly large.

16
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,497
 Plenty of steel
 for two swords.

17

                No.

23

      But as long as I'm better
      than everyone else,
      it doesn't matter.

24

 You can't serve
 in the Kingsguard

 protected the King
 while you were a prisoner.

 They will continue to do so
 when you go home.

 You'll return to Casterly Rock
 and rule in my stead.

              You are the Lord
              of Casterly Rock.

       Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.
       Man without honor.

40
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,029
      Now you want me to
      break another sacred vow.

41
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,897
 You won't be
 breaking anything.

42
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,100
 There is a precedent
 to relieve a Kingsguard
 of his duties.

43
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,970
 The King will
 exercise that prerogative.

                    No.

                 No.

47

 I don't believe I
 asked you a question.
             There's my answer.

48

 If you think
 your bloody honor
 comes before your...

49
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,368
     My bloody honor
     is beyond repair,
     but my answer is still no.

 by now, you never will.

55

           Go.

 If serving as
 a glorified bodyguard

57
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:15,857
 is the sum of your ambition,
 go serve.

58
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:17,459
           I suppose you
           want the sword back.

59
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,528
      Keep it.

             How lovely is she?

117
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,296

00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:13,981
             What happened
             to your family was
             a terrible crime.

                  I didn't know

313

        She was a strong woman.

402
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,772
 He can't disown you.
 You're all he's got.

403
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,474
      You're forgetting Tyrion.
 (SCOFFS)

404
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:28,245
 You don't really
 plan on staying
 in the Kingsguard, do you?

405
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:34,668
           Staying in
           the Kingsguard means

406
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,304
         I live right here in
         the Red Keep with you.

407
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:41,008
 Not now.
                 I want...

408
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,044
      Not now? When?
      I've been back for weeks.

409
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,702
       Something's changed.
          Everything's changed.

410
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:54,538
 You come back
 after all this time
 with no apologies and one hand

411
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,556
          and expect everything
          to be the same?

412
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:57,774
 What do you want
 me to apologize for?

413
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,009
                For leaving me.

414
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,610
 You think I wanted
 to be taken prisoner?

415
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,880
    Don't know what you wanted.
    You weren't here.

416
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:06,132
             You left me alone.

417
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:08,568
 Every day I was a prisoner,
 I plotted my escape.

418
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:09,887
 Every day.

419
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:12,222
 I murdered people
 so I could be here with you.

420
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,140
             You took too long.
     I...

421
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:18,996
 What are you saying?
       You took too long.

 JAIME: Go away.

424
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,518
        Forgive me, Your Grace.

425
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:28,388
           You told me to come
           at once if there was
           anything important.

00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:37,247
           (BLOWING)

427
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,094
        You plan on killing
        all the crows yourself?

428
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,148
 Do you plan on sitting here,
 scratching your
 balls till winter?

429
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,367
    We wait for Mance's orders.

430
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,652
 You sent a man over
 the Wall at the full moon.

431
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:01,588
 If he's not back yet,
 he's not coming back.

432
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,289
       And what is it you want?

433
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:06,093
          March on Castle Black
          with just this lot?

434
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,595
          Your pretty crow said
          a thousand men
          are nesting there.

435
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,129
         He's a liar.

        He is?

437
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:14,034
   Shouldn't it be "he was"?

438
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:17,003
      You said you put
      three arrows in him.

439
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:18,688
         I did.

440
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,592
     I've seen you slip a shaft
     through a rabbit's
     eye at 200 yards.

441
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:25,362

       not the north.

450
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:21,000
         Took a detour.

451
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,003
 Got some supper
 from a village down that way.

452
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:29,109
 Why does the meat down here
 taste so much better

453
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:31,561
 than it does on
 our side of the Wall?

 just better fed down here.

             you had with you,

462
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,889
                 lost him, too?

 I'll answer to Mance.

464

              No?

500
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:30,056
     You put your sword
     through a brother
     of the Night's Watch.

505
00:33:39,668 --> 00:33:41,818
         stop Mance was to get
         a man inside his army.

506
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:45,405
 Don't talk about the Halfhand
 as if you knew him.
 He was my brother.

507
00:33:45,474 --> 00:33:47,957
            Then you'd know
            he'd do anything
            to defend the Wall.

508
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,576
     The free folk would
     have boiled him alive,
     but letting me kill him...

 like a wildling now.

   I ate with the wildlings.

       with the wildlings. I...

513
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:03,990
               I laid with
               a wildling girl.

514
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,678

 breaking your vows, then?

00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:11,097
                  I do.

516
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,116
 The law is the law.

517
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,318
 The boy must die.

518
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,539
    If we beheaded every ranger
    who lay with a girl,

519
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:23,009
    the Wall would be
    manned by headless men.

520

 between sneaking off to

 and sleeping with the enemy.

              rules I broke,

       Mance Rayder
       marches on the Wall
       with an army of 100,000.

524
00:34:37,926 --> 00:34:39,425
          Impossible.

525
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,127
       You can't get 50
       wildlings together

526
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:42,729
      before they start
      killing each other.

528
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,868
        He's united the Thenns,
        the Hornfoots,
        the ice-river clans.

529
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:49,319
              He has giants
              fighting for him.

530
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:50,586
 (LAUGHS) Giants?

531
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,807
          Have you ever been
          beyond the Wall, ser?

532
00:34:54,877 --> 00:34:57,310
 I commanded the City Watch
 of King's Landing, boy.

533
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,511
           And now you're here.

534
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,163
         You must not have been
         very good at your job.

535
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:01,647
 How dare you?

536
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:04,550
             There's a band of
             wildlings south of
             the Wall already,

537
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,086
     led by Tormund Giantsbane.

538
00:35:06,154 --> 00:35:08,521
            I killed their warg
            and three others.

539
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,591
                They shot me
                full of arrows.

540
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:14,227
            Their orders are to
            attack Castle Black
            from the south

541
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:16,830
        when Mance
        hits it from the north.

542
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:19,699
                The signal for
                the attack will
                be a bonfire.

543
00:35:19,768 --> 00:35:22,568
       Mance said it would
       be the greatest fire
       the North has ever seen.

544
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:25,522
              That's the truth.

545
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,090
                 All the truth.

546
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:35,281
   Do you intend to execute me,
   or am I free to go?

547
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,383
           None of us are free.

548
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:39,636
             We are men of
             the Night's Watch.

549
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:43,756
         But we won't be taking
         your head today,
         Jon Snow.

550
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:44,891
 Go on.

551
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,605
 I am acting commander here,
 Maester Aemon.

552
00:35:58,673 --> 00:35:59,739
           Yes, you are.

553
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,041
 And I don't trust
 the bastard.

554
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,044
             He told the truth.

555
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:07,280
 And you always know
 when a man's telling a lie?

556
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:10,049
 How did you acquire
 this magical power?

557
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:13,987
                I grew up in
                King's Landing.

558
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,876
 OLENNA: No.

559
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,978
 You're a queen,
 not an ox.

560
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,849
             Your grandfather
             gave me a necklace

561
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,351
           just like this one
           for my 51st nameday.

562
00:36:31,173 --> 00:36:32,905
    The wedding is
    in a fortnight,
    Grandmother.

563
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:34,874
 You can't say
 no to everything.

564
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,643
               Nonsense.
               My little dears,

565
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,813
       go and speak
       to the jewelers
       of King's Landing.

566
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:43,366
     Tell them who you are,
     who sent you.

567
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:45,668
      The one who brings
      me the best necklace

568
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,104
      will get to
      keep the next best.

569
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:49,522
        (GIRLS LAUGHING)

570
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:56,813
        The Margaery Tyrell
        who walks into the Sept
        a fortnight from now

571
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,299
              will inspire
              a thousand songs.

572
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:02,134
             How sad it will be
             if she's wearing
             rubbish like that.

573
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:05,304
 Perhaps I should
 just let Joffrey
 choose it for me.

574
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:07,957
 End up with a string
 of dead sparrow heads
 around my neck.

575
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,494
            You watch that.
            Even here, with me.

576
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,879
    (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

577
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,515
                  My word.

578
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:18,051
            My lady.

579
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,620
       Please pardon me
       for interrupting.

580
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,089
       My name is
       Brienne of Tarth.

581
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,691
     We know who you are.
     We've heard all about you.

582
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,577
      But hearing is one thing.

583
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:30,613
    Aren't you just marvelous!

584
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:33,849
           Absolutely singular.

585
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,235
        I hear you knocked my
        grandson into the dirt,

586
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:39,322
              like the silly
              little boy he is.

587
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:42,191
      My lady, I know this
      is a very busy time
      for you,

588
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,243
      but if I could just
      have a moment.

589
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,230
      You dare not refuse.

590
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:51,751
     A shadow?

591
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:55,688
             With the face of
             Stannis Baratheon.

592
00:37:55,757 --> 00:38:00,025
                I swear to you
                by all the gods
                it was Stannis.

593
00:38:00,094 --> 00:38:03,796
          He plunged his sword
          through Renly's heart
          and disappeared.

594
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,967
               One day, I will
               avenge our king.

595
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,002
 Joffrey is our king now.

596
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:14,073
            I meant no offense.
 And you've given none.

597
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,768
 All the Kingsguard
 will be on duty.

598
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:27,770
 Ser Boros will
 be stationed here.

599
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,306
 Ser Preston will
 be stationed here,

600
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,741
 beside the primary
 entertainment.

601
00:38:34,696 --> 00:38:36,062
                  Your Grace?
              Huh?

602
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:41,217
    One guard at the thing.
    Go on.

603
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:44,620
      Ser Meryn will guard
      Lady Margaery and Tommen.

604
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,490
 I've always guarded
 the King himself,
 my lord.

605
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,124
 Ever since your absence.

606
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,660
             And I thank you
             for it, Ser Meryn.

607
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:54,463
  All very good.
  I don't expect any trouble.

608
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,349
  The people love their King.
  They know who keeps them fed.

609
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,085
               Margaery Tyrell,
               I've heard.

610
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,472
 By my leave.

611
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,524
 They know I saved the city.
 I won the war.

612
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,610
       The war's not won.
       Not while Stannis lives.

613
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,380
 I broke Stannis
 on the Blackwater.

614
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,548
 Pity you weren't
 there to help, Uncle.

615
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:15,268
      My apologies, Your Grace.
      I was rather busy.

616
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:17,203
 Busy getting captured.

617
00:39:18,907 --> 00:39:21,641
 So this is
 the famous
 Book of Brothers?

618
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:24,828
 All the great deeds
 of all the great Kingsguard.

619
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,433
 Ser Arthur Dayne.
 The Sword of the Morning.

620
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:31,534
 (CHUCKLES)

621
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,404
 Led the attack
 on the Kingswood Brotherhood.

622
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,857
 Defeated the Smiling Knight
 in single combat.

623
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,643
 Ser Duncan the Tall.

624
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,046
 (LAUGHS)

625
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:45,314
 Four pages.

626
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,433
 He must have been
 quite a man.
                  So they say.

627
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,271
 Ser Jaime Lannister.

628
00:39:52,941 --> 00:39:54,023
 Hmm. (CHUCKLES)

629
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,380
 Someone forgot to write down
 all your great deeds.

630
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:01,581
            There's still time.

631
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,233
 Is there?

632
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:06,151
 For a 40-year-old
 knight with one hand?

633
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,772
 How can you
 protect me with that?

634
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,774
             I use my left hand
             now, Your Grace.

635
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,310
                 Makes for more
                 of a contest.

636
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:15,378
 (SCOFFS)

637
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:33,312
 DAENERYS: Have you
 ever been to Meereen?

638
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:36,048
     Several times, Your Grace,
     with Master Kraznys.

639
00:40:36,117 --> 00:40:37,483
      And?

640
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:39,619
            They say a thousand
            slaves died

641
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,721
            building the Great
            Pyramid of Meereen.

642
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:45,425
 And now an army
 of former slaves
 is marching to her gates.

643
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,695
 You think the Great
 Masters are worried?

644
00:40:48,763 --> 00:40:50,963
      If they're smart,
      Your Grace.

645
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:57,737
      You were told to ride
      at the back of the train.

646
00:40:57,805 --> 00:40:59,555
 Yes, My Queen.

647
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,792
   But I need to speak to you
   about something important.

648
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,661
     A matter of strategy.

649
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:09,982
                    Your Grace.

650
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,155
 All right, what is
 this matter of strategy?

651
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,444
 A dusk rose.

652
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:24,347
 Would you like to walk
 at the back of the train
 instead of riding?

653
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,049
 And this one's
 called lady's lace.

654
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:29,585
            Would you like to
            walk without shoes?

655
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,371
 You have to know
 a land to rule it.

656
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:36,275
 Its plants, its rivers,
 its roads, its people.

657
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:38,578
 Dusk rose tea eases fever.

658
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:40,279
 Everyone in
 Meereen knows that.

659
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,832
 Especially the slaves
 who have to make the tea.

660
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:44,300
 If you want
 them to follow you,

661
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,885
 you have to become
 a part of their world.

662
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:47,003
 Strategy.

663
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,441
 Harpy's Gold.

664
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,077
 No tea from this one.

665
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,112
