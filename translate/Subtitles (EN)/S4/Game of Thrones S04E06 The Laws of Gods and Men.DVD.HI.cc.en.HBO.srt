        Gold you loaned him.

31
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,452
           And you feel
           your blood gives you
           a claim on our gold?

32
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:07,222
 More than any man living.

           Here, our books are
           filled with numbers.

37

          How many fighting men
          remain loyal to you?

         Ser Davos,

44
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,904
           not at the bottom
           of Blackwater Bay.

               wheat and barley

47
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,645
       and beef and pork do you
       produce on Dragonstone

48
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:52,467
         to feed your 4,000 men
         on your 32 ships?

00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,755
    None.

50
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,926
    You can see why these
    numbers seem unlikely
    to add up to a happy ending

51
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,862
          from our perspective.

52
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,784
          I'm afraid
          we must respectfully
          decline your request.

53
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:12,286
       But we thank you
       for paying us
       the honor of your visit.

          Ser Davos Seaworth.

56
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,819
          You would not be
          either here.

              In Braavos,

58
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,857
          thieves are not
          rewarded with titles.

59
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,359
 I didn't do the thieving.

60
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,060
 That would be the pirates.

61
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:40,899
 I just moved what they stole
 from one place to another.

62
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,452
 This is the payment
 that was demanded by
 King Stannis for my crimes.

63
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,738
   I consider it
   an honest accounting.

 He's an honest man and
 he's your best chance

65
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,309
 to get back the money
 you've sunk into Westeros.

66
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:54,579
     Which is a lot.
     Wars are expensive.

67
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:55,880
            The war is over.

68
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,633
 As long as Stannis lives,
 the war is not over.

69
00:06:58,702 --> 00:07:00,935
 Who's the real power
 in King's Landing?

70
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,221
                Ser Davos...
 Humor me.

71
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,522
               Tywin Lannister.

72
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,258
    How old is
    Tywin Lannister?

73
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,592
              Sixty-seven.

74
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,361
   And when he dies,
   who's in command?

75
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,796
   A half-grown boy,

76
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,614
 the product of incest?

77
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,735
 Cersei Lannister,
 a queen whose
 people despise her?

78
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,336
   Jaime Lannister,

79
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:22,224
 a man best known
 for killing the king
 he was sworn to protect?

80
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:26,227
  When Tywin's gone,
  who do you back?

81
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:28,146
           That is a problem
           for another time.

82
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,616
   I think it's
   a problem for now.

83
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,452
 There's only one
 reliable leader left
 in Westeros.

84
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:36,538
                       Stannis.

85
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:38,240
       He's got the birthright.

86
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:40,174
 He's in his prime.

87
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:42,294
 He's a tried and tested
 battle commander.

88
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,580
 And he doesn't just talk
 about paying people back,
 he does it.

       to his first mate,

     "Bring me my red shirt."

92
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,827
       The first mate brings
       the red shirt and
       the captain puts it on.

93
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,563
         And when the pirates
         try to board,

94
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:04,315
        the brave captain leads

         like scared mice.

98
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:15,376
         But the courageous
         captain hollers,

     "Bring me my red shirt!"

         After the battle,
         the first mate asks,

101
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:23,184
       "Captain, why do you
       call for your red shirt
       before battle?"

102
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,886
      The captain replies,

103
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:28,623
  "So that if I am stabbed,
  you will not see me bleed."

00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,442
      The next morning
      the lookout screams,

     "Ten pirate ships!
     We are surrounded!"

00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,133

          were not exaggerated.

271
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,033
   I thank you.

272
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,753
       Mine is one of the
       oldest and proudest
       families in Meereen.

273
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:22,122
       Then it is my honor
       to receive you.

274
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:23,791
           My father,

275
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,794
          one of Meereen's
          most respected
          and beloved citizens,

276
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:30,397
        oversaw the restoration
        and maintenance of
        its greatest landmarks.

277
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:32,049
         This pyramid included.

278
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,886
 For that, he has my gratitude.
 I should be
 honored to meet him.

279
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,571
          You have, Your Grace.

280
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,006
            You crucified him.

281
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:43,543
             I pray you'll
             never live to see

282
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,545
        a member of your family
        treated so cruelly.

283
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,966
     Your father crucified
     innocent children.

284
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,702
           My father spoke out
           against crucifying
           those children.

285
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,956
            He decried it as
            a criminal act,
            but was overruled.

286
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:59,343
        Is it justice to answer
        one crime with another?

287
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,545
 I am sorry you
 no longer have a father,

288
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:05,249
 but my treatment of
 the masters was no crime.

289
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,785
 You'd be wise
 to remember that.

290
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,171
           What's done is done.

291
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,074
             You are the queen
             and I am a servant
             of Meereen.

292
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:18,061
     A servant who does
     not wish to see
     its traditions eradicated.

293
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,698
 And what traditions
 do you speak of?

294
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,583
               Of funeral rite.

295
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,019
          Proper burial in the
          Temple of the Graces.

296
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:29,389
           My father and 162
           noble Meereenese

297
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,759
            are still nailed
            to those posts,

298
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,229
          carrion for vultures,
          rotting in the sun.

299
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,157
           Your Grace, I ask
           that you order
           these men taken down

300
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,460
        so that they might
        receive proper burials.

301
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:53,580
 And what of the slave
 children these noble
 Meereenese crucified?

302
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:56,250
 They were rotting
 in the sun as well.

303
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:59,603
 Would you have begged me
 for their right
 to a proper burial?

304
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:02,590
           Your Grace, I cannot
           defend the actions
           of the masters.

305
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:06,393
          I can only speak
          to you as a son
          who loved his father.

306
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:09,696
     Let me take his body down.

307
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:11,865
          Let me have him
          brought to the temple

308
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:15,352
       and buried with dignity
       so that he might find
       peace in the next world.

309
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,593
       Bury your father,
       Hizdahr zo Loraq.

310
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,516
          Thank you, my queen.

311
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,779
 How many more?

312
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,699
 There are 212
 supplicants waiting,
 Your Grace.

313
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:48,702
        212?

314
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,629
     Send the next one in.

315
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:03,683
          These meetings aren't
          always going to be
          this early, are they?

316
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,253
   I was up late last night.

317
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:10,273
    So, does this mean
    I am a master
    of something now?

318
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,209
                 Coins, ships?

319
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,661
        Lord Tywin and I
        already determined that

320
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,898
           I shall be
           the Master of Ships
           long before you...

321
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,738
           Lord Tywin,
           it's a great honor

322
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:27,224
          to have been
          granted a seat
          on this council. I...

323
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,292
     TYWIN: The trial
     begins this afternoon.

324
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,528
    We only have the morning
    for affairs of state.

325
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,630
      So, shall we begin?

326
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,784
       VARYS: Sandor Clegane
       has been spotted in
       the Riverlands, my lord.

327
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,403
        A coward and a traitor.

328
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:43,306
 My birds tell me
 the Hound slaughtered
 five of our soldiers.

329
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:46,309
 I believe the phrase
 "fuck the king"
 was uttered.

330
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,944
             Disgraceful.

331
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,047
     TYWIN: What
     would it take to make
     the common soldier

332
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,115
    stupid enough to try
    his luck with the Hound?

333
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:55,018
       VARYS: Ten silver stags
       seems a generous bounty.

334
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,738
            Make it 100.
            What else?

335
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,240
 More whispers from
 the east, my lord.

336
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,942
    The Targaryen girl?

337
00:26:02,011 --> 00:26:04,945
 Daenerys has taken up
 residence in Meereen.

338
00:26:05,014 --> 00:26:08,398
 She has conquered the city
 and rules as its queen.

339
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,866
           Conquered with what?

340
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,935
 VARYS: She commands
 an army of Unsullied,
 my queen.

341
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,121
 Some 8,000 strong.

342
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,874
 She has a company
 of sellswords,
 the Second Sons.

343
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,243
            She has two knights
            advising her,

344
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,530
 Jorah Mormont and
 Barristan Selmy.

345
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,515
 And she has three dragons.

346
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:26,917
                  Baby dragons.

347
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,353
 Larger every year,
 Your Grace.

348
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,589
              Mormont is spying
              on her for us.

349
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:35,809
 No longer.
 He appears to be
 fully devoted to her.

350
00:26:35,878 --> 00:26:37,828
 As for Ser Barristan,

351
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:40,196
 it would seem he
 took his dismissal

352
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,183
 from the Kingsguard
 a bit harder
 than anticipated.

353
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,968
               He's an old man.

354
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,970
               He wasn't fit to
               protect my son.

355
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:49,689
      Joffrey didn't
      die on his watch.

356
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:52,609
      Dismissing him
      was as insulting
      as it was stupid.

357
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:53,877
           Don't tell me
           you're worried about

358
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,079
              a child halfway
              across the world.

359
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,449
 A child with two
 seasoned warriors
 counseling her

360
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:02,152
 and a powerful army at
 her back, Your Grace.

361
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:04,321
           Lord Varys is right.

362
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,657
       I have been to Essos
       and seen
       the Unsullied firsthand.

363
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,643
       They are very impressive
       on the battlefield.

364
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,379
 Less so in the bedroom.

365
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:15,132
   Dragons haven't won
   a war in 300 years.

366
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,768
     Armies win them
     all the time.

367
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,487
 She must be dealt with.

368
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,523
 How, my lord?
 By force?

369
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:25,492
       Eventually, if it
       comes to that.

370
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,980
   Can your little birds
   find their way into Meereen?

371
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,849
 Most certainly,
 my Lord Hand.

372
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:37,520
  Mmm.
  Lord Tyrell, be a good man.
  Fetch my quill and paper.

373
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,735
        (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

374
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,510
       Prince Oberyn.

375
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,296
               Lord Varys.

376
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:06,199
 Only Varys. I'm not
 actually a nobleman.

377
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,752
 No one is under
 obligation
 to call me lord.

378
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:10,420
        And yet everyone does.

379
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,592
 You seem
 quite knowledgeable
 about the Unsullied.

380
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,761
 Did you spend
 much time in Essos?

381
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,496
              Five years.

382
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,633
 May I ask why?

383
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,502
             'Tis a big and
             beautiful world.

384
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:29,272
         Most of us live and
         die in the same corner
         where we were born

385
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:32,759
            and never get
            to see any of it.

386
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:34,795
              I don't want
              to be most of us.

387
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:36,629
 Most of us aren't princes.

388
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,518
            (CHUCKLES)
            You are from Essos.

389
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,404
                  Where? Lys?

390
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:47,407
     I have an ear for accents.

391
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,293
 I've lost
 my accent entirely.

392
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:50,894
              I have an ear
              for that as well.

393
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,062
       Hmm.

394
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,965
          How did you get here?

395
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,833
 It's a long story.

396
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,519
             One you don't like
             telling people.

397
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,439
  People I trust.

398
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:05,342
           My paramour Ellaria,

 that without me,
 this city would have
 faced certain defeat.
