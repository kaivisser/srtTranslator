00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,302
           You're not a Bolton.
           You're a Snow.

141
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,742
            Tywin Lannister has
            given me the North.

142
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,195
 But he won't lift a finger
 to help me take it.

143
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,380
 As long as the ironborn
 hold Moat Cailin,

144
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,849
 our armies are
 trapped south of the Neck.

145
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,636
  Theon was a valuable hostage,
  not your plaything.

146
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:51,288
          I wanted to trade him
          for Moat Cailin.

147
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,157
 I already asked.

148
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,593
 Lord Greyjoy refused.

149
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,811
 Savages have no...

150
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,647
            You sent terms
            to Balon Greyjoy
            without my consent?

151
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,882
 You made me acting
 Lord of the Dreadfort.

152
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:02,950
    I acted.

153
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:13,861
      I had to smuggle
      myself into my own lands,
      thanks to the Greyjoys.

154
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,865
          I needed Theon whole.

155
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:21,302
 Theon was our enemy.

156
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,387
        But Reek

157
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,823
 will never betray us.

158
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,494
             I placed far too
             much trust in you.

159
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:42,757
 Reek,
 how could you let me stand
 before my father unshaven?

160
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:44,342
 It's disrespectful.

161
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,826
                Sorry, my lord.

162
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,881
 Give him the razor.

163
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:01,192
 I'm not a Bolton, Father.
 What does it matter?

164
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,051
        Go on, Reek.

165
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,388
     A nice close shave.

166
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,825
 Reek,

167
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,179
           tell Father,

168
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:41,049
         where are Bran
         and Rickon Stark?

169
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,767
        I don't know, my lord.

170
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,118
            You murdered them

171
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,506
         and displayed their
         corpses at Winterfell.

172
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,841
 RAMSAY: Reek,

173
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,245
          did you murder
          the Stark boys?

174
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,013
       No, my lord.

175
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,699
     Just two farm boys.

176
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,968
 RAMSAY: And crisped them
 so no one would know?

177
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:02,870
 THEON: Yes, my lord.

178
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,042
 The Starks have
 always ruled the North.

179
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,177
 If Bran and Rickon are alive,

180
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:12,880
 the country will
 rally to their side,

181
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,216
   now that Robb Stark is gone.

182
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,254
       Oh, that's right, Reek.

183
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,291
       Robb Stark is dead.

184
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,644
                  Sorry.

185
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,930
             I know he was like
             a brother to you.

186
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,215
   But my father put
   a knife through his heart.

187
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,754
    How do you feel about that?

188
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,794
    (WHIMPERING)

189
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,520
          You ready for a hunt?
          Always.

190
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:56,307
    Find those boys
    and I'll give you
    1,000 acres and a holdfast.

191
00:12:56,376 --> 00:13:00,078
 Your pet rat have any
 thoughts on which way
 they went after Winterfell?

192
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,298
   Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

193
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:07,835
 Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

194
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:09,771
         Their bastard brother.

195
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,639
   He could be sheltering them.

196
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,940
    He may know where they are.

197
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:18,630
 Even if he doesn't,
 he's half Stark himself.

198
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:19,947
 Could be a threat.

199
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:22,917
             You want to prove
             yourself a Bolton?

200
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:26,404
    Gather whatever men you can
    and ride for Moat Cailin.

201
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,771
  Bring this creature of yours.

202
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:31,226
    Maybe he'll be of some use.

203
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,581
  Take the Moat for the family,
  for our family,

204
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,018
            and I'll reconsider
            your position.

205
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:46,440
        Lord Varys.
        Breakfasting
        with the King?

206
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:49,911
 I'm afraid foreigners
 aren't welcome at
 such exclusive affairs.

207
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,779
      Oh, to be foreign.

208
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:54,716
         (CLEARS THROAT)
         Shae has been noticed.

209
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:58,019
          Sansa's maid saw you
          with her. She already
          told your sister.

210
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,888
     It's only a matter of time
     before your father hears.

211
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:03,524
 So I'm guilty of
 being seen with
 my own wife's handmaiden.

212
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,493
 My father will ask you
 if there's anything more,

213
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,061
 and you'll tell him
 some clever lie.

214
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,030
                No, I will not.

215
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,833
        How long do you imagine
        your father and sister
        would let me live

216
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:14,301
           if they suspected me
           of lying?

217
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,871
        I have no pet sellsword
        to protect me.

218
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,290
           No legendary brother
           to avenge me.

219
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,592
         Only little birds
         who whisper in my ear.

220
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:23,544
 Forgive me
 if I don't weep for you.

221
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,914
      No one weeps for spiders,
      or whores.

222
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,250
            I have friends
            across the sea
            who could help her.

223
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:30,685
 She won't leave.

224
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:32,520
 I've told her
 this is a dangerous place

225
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,288
 so many times,
 she no longer believes it.

226
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:35,923
               Your father has
               promised to hang

227
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:37,525
             the next whore
             he finds you with.

228
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:40,862
        Have you ever
        known your father
        to make an idle threat?

229
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,634
   MACE: From House Tyrell
   and the people of the Reach,

230
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:50,972
     Your Grace, it is my honor
     to present you
     with this wedding cup.

231
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,493
      May you and
      my daughter Margaery
      drink deep and live long.

232
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,661
         A handsome goblet,
         my lord.

233
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,880
          Or shall I call
          you Father?

234
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,982
           I should be honored,
           Your Grace.

235
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,159
 She's the whore
 I told you about.

236
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,479
 The dark-haired one.

237
00:15:15,532 --> 00:15:18,900
      Have her brought to
      the Tower of the Hand
      before the wedding.

238
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:19,967
    Hmm.

239
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,378
              A book?

240
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:31,678
       The Lives of Four Kings.

241
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:33,580
          Grand Maester Kaeth's
          history of

242
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,716
       the reigns of
       Daeron the Young Dragon,

243
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:37,368
            Baelor the Blessed,

244
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,770
           Aegon the Unworthy,
           and Daeron the Good.

245
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,355
              A book every king
              should read.

246
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,050
 Now that the war is won,

247
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,320
 we should all
 find time for wisdom.

248
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,889
    Thank you, Uncle.

 in your honor.

252

 Nothing cuts
 like Valyrian steel.

253
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,360
             So they say.

256
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,859
         Such a great sword
         should have a name.
         What shall I call her?

 MAN 4: Wolfsbane.

260
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:57,831
            Widow's Wail.
            I like that.

           Every time I use it,

263
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,604
          it'll be like cutting
          off Ned Stark's head
          all over again.

     Don't.

266
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,872
       You want me on the desk?

267
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,209

           Don't call me that.

00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:46,464
        What should I call you?

 I'm afraid our
 friendship can't continue.

271
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,352
                Our friendship?

 There's a ship
 waiting in the harbor
 bound for Pentos.

                       What?

274
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,791

 You're Lord Selwyn
 Tarth's daughter.

543
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,431
 That makes you a lady
 whether you want
 to be or not.

544
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,383
        As you say, Your Grace.

545

 You returned
 my brother safely
 to King's Landing.

547
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,559
     In truth,
     he rescued me, Your Grace.

 Catelyn Stark,
 and now my brother.

 from one camp to the next,

      and I will
      examine you personally.

560

        sought my advice...

562

565
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:41,591
         Brought shame on
         the Citadel with his
         repugnant experiments.

566
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,827
 More repugnant than
 your gnarled fingers
 on that girl's thighs?

 My little brother
 had you sent to

569
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,516

 when you annoyed him.

570
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:51,484
 What do you think
 I could do to you?

571
00:37:51,553 --> 00:37:53,586
             I never meant
             to annoy anyone.

 You're annoying me right now.

    draw in my presence
    annoys me.

574
00:37:58,794 --> 00:38:01,594
   So here's what
   I want you to do.
   Leave my presence.

 from the feast

578

 the leftovers
 will feed the dogs,

601
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:31,617

          in Dorne.

 No? How tolerant of you.

603

       Lady Cersei,

604
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,107
        giving up your
        regal responsibilities.

 I suppose you'll
 never know, Prince Oberyn.

 It's a shame
 your older brother
 couldn't attend the wedding.

00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,818
          JOFFREY: Well fought.

675
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:44,637
              Here you are.
              Champion's purse.

676
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,992
     Though you're not
     the champion yet, are you?

677
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:54,947
        A true champion defeats
        all the challengers.

678
00:43:55,016 --> 00:43:57,083
               Surely there are
               others out there

679
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:59,185
            who still dare to
            challenge my reign.

680
00:44:00,154 --> 00:44:01,737
                    Uncle.

681
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,874
          How about you?
          I'm sure they
          have a spare costume.

682
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:13,865
 One taste of combat
 was enough for me,
 Your Grace.

683
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:16,619
 I would like to keep
 what remains of my face.

684
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,704
 I think you
 should fight him.

685
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:22,542
 This was but a poor imitation
 of your own bravery
 on the field of battle.

686
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,495
 I speak as
 a firsthand witness.

687
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:28,781
 Climb down from
 the high table with
 your new Valyrian sword

688
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:32,151
 and show everyone
 how a true king
 wins his throne.

689
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,720
 Be careful, though.

690
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:38,040
 This one is
 clearly mad with lust.

691
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:41,577
 It would be a tragedy for
 the King to lose his virtue

692
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:44,279
 hours before
 his wedding night.

693
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,015
     (CROWD LAUGHS LIGHTLY)

694
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:16,378
                A fine vintage.

695
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,963
         Shame that it spilled.

696
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,083
              It did not spill.

697
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:22,234
 My love, come back to me.

698
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,370
     It's time for
     my father's toast.

699
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:25,771
       (SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

700
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,741
            JOFFREY: How does
            he expect me to
            toast without wine?

701
00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:35,481
 Uncle, you can be
 my cupbearer

702
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,100
 seeing as you're
 too cowardly to fight.

703
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,319
 Your Grace does me
 a great honor.

704
00:45:40,388 --> 00:45:42,905
 It's not meant as an honor.

705
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:15,804
 Bring me my goblet.

706
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,280
 What good is an empty cup?

707
00:46:42,283 --> 00:46:43,282
       Fill it.

708
00:46:57,465 --> 00:46:58,481
         Kneel.

709
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,168
 Kneel before your king.

710
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:09,592
         Kneel.

711
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,419
     I said kneel!

712
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:25,624
               Look, the pie.

713
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,977
            (APPLAUSE)

714
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,407
           My Queen.

             (GASPS)

716

 MARGAERY: Wonderful.

717
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:01,560
 My hero.

718
00:48:05,032 --> 00:48:06,398
              Can we leave now?

719
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:07,732
 Let's find out.

720
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:17,727
                   Uncle.

721
00:48:21,516 --> 00:48:22,865
     Where are you going?

722
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:24,967
    You're my cupbearer,
    remember?

723
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:27,636
 I thought I might
 change out of these
 wet clothes, Your Grace.

724
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,239
      No, you're perfect
      the way you are.

725
00:48:31,925 --> 00:48:33,492
       Serve me my wine.

726
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:41,667
      Hurry up.
      This pie is dry.

727
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,643
                Mmm, good.

728
00:48:52,546 --> 00:48:54,613
 Needs washing down.

729
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,914
       If it please Your Grace,

730
00:48:55,983 --> 00:48:58,517
      Lady Sansa is very tired.
       No. (COUGHS)

731
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,620
 No, you'll wait here...

00:49:26,614 --> 00:49:27,963
                Move away!

           we have to leave.
