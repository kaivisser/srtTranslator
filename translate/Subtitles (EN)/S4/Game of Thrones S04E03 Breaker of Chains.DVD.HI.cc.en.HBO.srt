 executed your father,

 who tormented you for years,

45
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,839

68

          if Joffrey had
          done you the courtesy

69
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:32,407
     of consummating
     the marriage before dying.

70
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:37,328
            This would not be
            an opportune moment
            to press the issue.

71
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,798
 Clawing at his own throat,
 looking to his mother
 to make it stop...

       The world is overflowing
       with horrible things.

        of cakes next to death.

75
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,393
        They brought me
        your grandfather's body
        when he died.

76
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,278
            Made me look at it.

77
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,780
 What was it like?

78
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,650
                They took me to
                the Great Hall.
                There he was.

79
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:03,221
            The man I'd married
            and suffered to
            father my children.

80
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,090
            A great doughy lump
            I'd sat next to

81
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,327
        at endless dinners
        and tedious gatherings.

82
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,495
                  There he was,

83
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,015
              lying on a table.

84
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,121
 One of my husbands
 preferred the company of men

85
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,090
 and was stabbed
 through the heart.

86
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,359
 Another was
 happiest torturing animals

87
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:26,845
 and was poisoned at
 our wedding feast.

88
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:28,713
     I must be cursed.
                     Nonsense.

89
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,466
        Your circumstances
        have improved markedly.

90
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:36,254
      You may not have
      enjoyed watching him die,

91
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,156
    but you enjoyed it more
    than you would have enjoyed

92
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,208
        being married to him,
        I can promise you that.

93
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:42,276
     But I would have
     been the queen.

94
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,395
            Our alliance
            with the Lannisters

95
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,915
    remains every bit
    as necessary to them
    as it is unpleasant for us.

96
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,587
              You did wonderful
              work on Joffrey.

97
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:54,722
             The next one
             should be easier.

99
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,972
               Do you know
               what that means?

100
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:16,377
           I'm not trying
           to trick you.

101
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:20,281
 It means I'll become king.

102
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,551
             Yes, you will
             become king.

103
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,820
           What kind of king do
           you think you'll be?

104
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,306
 A good king?

105
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,474
                    TYWIN: Mmm.

106
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,476
          I think so as well.

107
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,597
         You've got the right
         temperament for it.

108
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,917
              But what makes
              a good king? Hmm?

109
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,004
         What is a good king's
         single most
         important quality?

110
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:45,039
        This is hardly
        the place or the time.

111
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,075
 Holiness?
               Hmm.

112
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,997
             Baelor the Blessed
             was holy.

113
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,865
           And pious.

114
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,585
         He built this Sept.

115
00:08:57,654 --> 00:09:00,755
   He also named
   a 6-year-old boy High Septon

116
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:03,974
   because he thought
   the boy could work miracles.

117
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:08,129
            He ended up
            fasting himself
            into an early grave

118
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:12,467
         because food was
         of this world and
         this world was sinful.

119
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:13,567
                    Hmm.

120
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,238
    Justice.
                        Mmm.

121
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,492
      A good king must be just.

122
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,496
               Orys I was just.

123
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,031
         Everyone
         applauded his reforms,

124
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,133
    nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,036
   But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:35,656
   He was murdered in his sleep
   after less than a year
   by his own brother.

127
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,877
                 Was that truly
                 just of him?

128
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,178
        To abandon his subjects
        to an evil that

129
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,564
         he was too
         gullible to recognize?

130
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:44,699
       No.

131
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:45,766
                        No.

132
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:49,570
 What about strength?

133
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,972
                      Yes.

                     Strength.

135
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,144
        King Robert was strong.

136
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:58,279
           He won the rebellion

137
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,017
         and crushed
         the Targaryen dynasty.

138
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:06,688
          And he attended
          three Small Council
          meetings in 17 years.

139
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:11,009
            He spent his time
            whoring and hunting
            and drinking

140
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:14,712
       until the last two
       killed him.

141
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,382
              So, we have a man
              who starves
              himself to death,

142
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,619
        a man who lets his
        own brother murder him,

143
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:25,156
        and a man who thinks
        that winning and ruling
        are the same thing.

144
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,111
         What do they all lack?

145
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,684
   Wisdom.
                    Yes!

146

148
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,241
       But what is wisdom? Hmm?

149
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,780
   A house with great
   wealth and fertile lands
   asks you for your protection

150
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:55,886
      against another house
      with a strong navy that
      could one day oppose you.

151
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,107
           How do you know
           which choice is wise
           and which isn't?

    of treasuries and granaries

153
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:05,396
     or shipyards and soldiers?

154

156
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,285

           knows what he knows
           and what he doesn't.

               You're young.

158
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,857
      A wise young king
      listens to his counselors

159
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,178
         and heeds their advice
         until he comes of age.

          them long afterwards.

162
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,170
            Your brother was
            not a wise king.

163
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:31,306
             Your brother was
             not a good king.

164
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,441
               If he had been,

165
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,127
           perhaps
           he'd still be alive.

166
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:39,147
        Now, as the king,
        you will have to marry.

170

           the family line.

172

          explained the details
          to you?

401

         I said those words
         when I tossed
         a leech into the fire,

402
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:00,090

405

 to pay men to fight?

     ache in the night,

 Or his grandfather.

 An awful way to die.

 Which way is that?

         we live inside the eye
         of a blue-eyed giant.

         The King was poisoned.

 I hear you studied
 poisons at the Citadel.

569
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:10,390
     I did. This is why I know.

570
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:14,110
 Your hatred for my family
 is rather well-known.

571
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,829
 You arrive at the capital,
 an expert in poisoning,

        thrown me in a dungeon?

00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:27,791
 You spoke with Tyrion
 in this very brothel
 on the day that you arrived.

576
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:30,544
 What did you discuss?

577
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:32,178
         You think
         we conspired together?

         Of course I blame you.

 Here I stand unarmed,
 unguarded.

 Should I be concerned?

586
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:53,082
      You are unarmed and
      unguarded because you
      know me better than that.

    I will be drawn and

    Men at war commit

 superiors' knowledge.

591
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,778
        So you deny involvement
        in Elia's murder?

       I would like to
       speak with the Mountain.

594
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,612
 I'm sure he would
 enjoy speaking with you.

595
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,581
          He might not enjoy it
          as much as
          he thinks he would.

596
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:30,970
 I could arrange
 for this meeting.

597
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,874
     But you want
     something in return.

598
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:39,078
       There will be
       a trial for my son
       and, as custom dictates,

599
00:36:39,147 --> 00:36:41,948
              three judges will
              render a verdict.

600
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:43,466
                I will preside.

601
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:47,070
         Mace Tyrell will serve
         as the second judge.

602
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,821
               I would like you
               to be the third.

603
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,023
        Why?

604
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:54,627
          Not long ago,
          the Tyrells sided
          with Renly Baratheon.

605
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:57,380
         Declared themselves
         enemies of the throne.

606
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,549
          Now they are
          our strongest allies.

607
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:02,151
 Well, you made
 the Tyrell girl a queen.

608
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,805
 Asking me to judge
 at your son's trial
 isn't quite as tempting.

609
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:09,342
 I would also invite you
 to sit on the Small Council

610
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:12,912
 to serve as one of
 the new king's
 principal advisors.

611
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:23,473
 I never realized
 you had such respect
 for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

612

           We are not the Seven
           Kingdoms until Dorne
           returns to the fold.

613
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:31,213
             The King is dead.
             The Greyjoys are
             in open rebellion.

614
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,050
           A wildling army
           marches on the Wall.

615
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:38,387
   And in the east,
   a Targaryen girl
   has three dragons.

616
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:44,109
     Before long,
     she will turn her
     eyes to Westeros.

 managed to resist

618
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,448
     Aegon Targaryen
     and his dragons.

              for you to admit.

 We need each other.

 You help me serve justice
 to the King's assassins,

 serve justice to Elia's.

           of a family tragedy.

659
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:55,958
 I'm supposed to get
 a list of names from you,
 my lord.

660
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:58,511
 Anyone who might
 testify on your behalf.

661
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:00,212
              Oh, I can call
              my own witnesses?

662
00:40:01,116 --> 00:40:02,665
          How generous of them.

663
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,534
     Very well, my wife. Sansa.

664
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:06,669
 My lord, she's gone.

665
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,204
                     Gone?

666
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:09,705
 No one's seen her
 since the wedding.

667
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,395
 You don't think she...

668
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,168
          No one had more
          cause to kill Joffrey
          than Sansa,

669
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:24,237
                but the girl
                is no assassin.

670
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:27,440
        Whoever killed the King
        wanted me to
        lose my head for it.

671
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,275
          And with my
          wife's disappearance,

672
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,811
         it makes me seem
         that much more guilty.

673
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:33,930
                  Podrick.
 Yes, my lord?

674
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,498
  They'll be following you now.
      Who will?

675
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,301
        I don't know.
        They. The ominous they.

676
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:42,138
   The man pulling the strings.
   Or woman. My father.

677
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,907
         Maybe Joffrey was
         too much work for him.

678
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:48,411
      Sweet Tommen will be
      so much easier to handle.

679
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,747
             Whenever something
             bad happens to me,

680
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,349
        I assume it's my sister
        that had a hand in it.

681
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,501
               But say what you
               will of Cersei,

682
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,236
        she loves her children.

683
00:40:57,305 --> 00:40:59,238
            She is the only one
            I'm certain

684
00:40:59,307 --> 00:41:01,574
              had nothing to do
              with this murder.

685
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:05,945
          Which makes it unique
          as King's Landing
          murders go.

686
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:08,831
 Any other witnesses,
 my lord?

687
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,816
           Varys could vouch
           for me, if he dared.

688
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,901
 He's already been called
 as a witness for the Queen.

689
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,904
        Of course. Fetch Bronn.
        I have a job for him.

690
00:41:15,957 --> 00:41:17,656
 I've already asked, my lord.
 They won't let him see you.

691
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,241
                     Why not?

692
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,411
 They say he's
 a known cutthroat
 and your close associate.

693
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,979
 He's under
 investigation himself.

694
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:26,332
         And my brother?
         Will they at least
         allow me to see Jaime?

695
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,466
 I'll ask, my lord.

696
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,368
 There's something else,
 my lord.

697
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:48,671
 A man,
 I didn't know his face,

698
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,441
 he came to ask if I'd
 testify against you.

699
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,210
 Said I'd be named
 Ser Podrick Payne

700
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,863
 if I told the judges
 you'd bought a poison
 called the strangler.

701
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,965
           Ser Podrick Payne?

702
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:02,034
         Has a nice ring to it.
         What did you tell him?

703
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,069
 I didn't tell them
 anything, my lord.

704
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,658
            Are you going to
            accept their offer?

705
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,527
      My lord.
          Testifying against me
          wasn't a suggestion.

706
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,262
          If they can't
          tempt you with honey,

707
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,897
          they'll choose
          something less sweet.

708
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,849
 You've been good
 to me, my lord.

709

               in a fortnight.

710
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,486
         They'll want
         an answer before that.

711
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:21,804
 I already gave them
 an answer, my lord.

712
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,892
            I will not have you
            dying on my behalf.

713
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:28,911
               Do you hear me?

       that long walk to
       the executioner's block,

715
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,482
     I don't want to see
     your head already mounted.

        Go and find my brother.
        Tell him I need him.

719
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,043
          And get yourself
          out of King's Landing
          before it's too late.

00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:37,069
         I told the wildlings
         we had over 1,000 men
         at Castle Black alone.

793
00:47:37,138 --> 00:47:41,023
            Karl and the others
            know the truth
            as well as we do.

      they'll keep that
      information to themselves

795
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:47,396
         when the wildlings
         are peeling
         their fingernails off?

             As soon as he gets

             he will.

798
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:57,323
       Then he'll throw
       his full strength at us.

799
00:47:57,391 --> 00:48:00,209
    And even if every one of us
    kills 100 wildlings,

800
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:02,862
      there's still not a thing
      we can do to stop them.

801
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,483
 I don't think I can
 kill 100 wildlings.
