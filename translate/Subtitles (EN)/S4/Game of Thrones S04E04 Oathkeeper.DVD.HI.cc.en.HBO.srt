143

 reason than anyone
 in the Seven Kingdoms.

 it's a coincidence

 she disappeared
 the same night Joffrey died?

 I'm getting married
 to your Aunt Lysa.

         Did I kill Joffrey?

158
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,576
 I've been in
 the Vale for weeks.

159
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,561
             I know it was you.

160
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,347
 And who helped me
 with this conspiracy?

161
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:54,502
          There was Ser Dontos.

162
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,570
      You used him to get me
      out of King's Landing,

163
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,607
    but you would never
    trust him to kill the King.

164
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:00,891
         Why not?

165
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,593
        Because you're too
        smart to trust a drunk.

166
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,362
  Then perhaps
  it was your husband.

             No.

169

          I just do.

170
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,939
    You're right.
    He wasn't involved
    in Joffrey's death.

171
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,510
     But you were.

172

 Do you remember
 that lovely necklace
 Dontos gave you?

173
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:28,619
 I don't suppose you noticed
 that a stone was
 missing after the feast.

176
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,562
            The Lannisters gave
            you wealth, power.

177
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,032
         Joffrey made you
         the Lord of Harrenhal.

178
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,252
 A man with no motive
 is a man no one suspects.

 Always keep
 your foes confused.

 you are or what you want,

 they can't know what
 you plan to do next.

182

           I don't believe you.

183
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,752
          If they catch you,
          they'll put your head

184
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,987
              on a spike just
              like my father's.

    You'd risk that
    just to confuse them?

186
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:11,612
 So many men,
 they risk so little.

187
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:14,181
 They spend their
 lives avoiding danger.

188
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,500
 And then they die.

189
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,439
 I'd risk everything
 to get what I want.

190
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,692
          And what do you want?

191

        Everything.

192
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:38,122
 My friendship
 with the Lannisters
 was productive.

193
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,491
 But Joffrey,

194
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,463
 a vicious boy with
 a crown on his head,
 is not a reliable ally.

195
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,682
 And who could trust
 a friend like that?

196

           Who could trust you?

 I don't want friends like me.

198
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,806
    My new friends
    are predictable.

 happened to Joffrey,

201
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:04,648
 that was something
 my new friends
 wanted very badly.

202

 a thoughtful gift

 more leisurely stroll
 through these gardens,

00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,055
              I'll fling myself
              from the cliffs.

                    No.

214
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,297

 agreed to the match?
 No one tells me anything.

215

            I wasn't originally
            meant to marry your
            grandfather Luthor.

216
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:46,374
   He was engaged to my sister,
   your great-aunt Viola.

217
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:49,560
       I was to be given to
       some Targaryen or other.

218
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,246
    Marrying a Targaryen
    was all the rage back then.

219
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:56,117
             But the moment
             I saw my intended,

220
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:58,953
           with his twitchy
           little ferret's face

     and ludicrous silver hair,

          So the evening
          before Luthor was to
          propose to my sister,

223
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:11,465
      I got lost on my way back
      from my embroidery lesson

224
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:13,968
              and happened
              upon his chamber.

228
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:21,642
         The following morning,
         Luthor never made
         it down the stairs

229
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:25,512
        to propose to my sister
        'cause the boy
        couldn't bloody walk.

230

       the only thing he wanted

231
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:30,083
         was what I'd given him
         the night before.

        It was reforged
        from Ned Stark's sword.

00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,635
   You'll use it to
   defend Ned Stark's daughter.

430
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:06,373
              You swore an oath

431

      to return the Stark girls

    a chance to find Sansa
    and get her somewhere safe.

        I've got

            I hope I got your
            measurements right.

 I'll find her.

              Of course you do.

 What are you
 waiting for, a kiss?

    have taken her away.

 She's not safe out there.

462
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:25,922
 I should have known.

463
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,690
 You told us
 there were wildlings
 south of the Wall.

464
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,494
 If they're raiding
 the smaller villages,
 Mole's Town could be next.

465
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,228
    Castle Black could be next.

466
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,796
 I should go back for Gilly.

467
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,465
              We have orders.
              No one's to
              leave the castle.

468
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,001
 I remember when
 you disobeyed orders
 and rode south to help Robb.

469
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,152
           And I remember
           who came after me
           and brought me home.

470
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:46,192
         I know how hard it is,
         Sam, believe me.

471
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:50,663
    When you told me about
    Bran going beyond the Wall,

472
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,498
    all I could think about was
    getting my strength back

473
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,251
    so I could go and find him.

474
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,787
 I wish I could
 have convinced him
 to come back with me.

475
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,058
 I tried. Really, I did.

476
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,363
    How fast could they travel?

477

       being pulled on a sledge
       by a simpleton?

478
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,001
 I don't know.

479
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,837
 They'd pass
 wildling villages.

480
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,974
 They could try and find
 shelter at one of them.

481
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,794
          The wildlings have
          joined up with Mance.

        I'll sanction it.

 anyone to go with you.

    (CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE)

496
00:37:26,428 --> 00:37:28,945
 I'm going beyond
 the Wall to Craster's Keep

497
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,014
 to capture the mutineers
 holed up there

498
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,749
 or kill them.

499

 I'm asking for
 volunteers to come with me.

 There's 60 miles of wilderness
 between here and Craster's,

501
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:44,193
   and Mance Rayder has an army
   bearing down on us,

502
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,412
        but we have to do this.

503
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,015
 Our survival may depend
 on us getting to

504
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:51,650
 these mutineers
 before Mance does.

505
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,755
 They know the Wall.
 They know our defenses.

506

 If Mance learns what
 they know, we're lost.

507
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,462
      But if that's not enough,

508
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:05,582
           then consider this.

509

              for the Watch

512
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:16,976

            by his own men.
