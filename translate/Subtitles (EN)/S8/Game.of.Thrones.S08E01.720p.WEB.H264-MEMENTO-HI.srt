my brother would tell me

a bedtime story, about the man

About all the things we would

The kind of pomp and majesty
of Dany's arrival,

667
00:55:52,874 --> 00:55:55,165
it just felt like the natural
place to start the season.

668
00:55:55,248 --> 00:55:57,248
The arrival was a way to capture

00:55:57,332 --> 00:55:59,998
what was at stake
for Dany and for Jon.

670
00:56:00,207 --> 00:56:02,332
Looking back
to the very beginning

671
00:56:02,415 --> 00:56:04,040
and how young Maisie was
back then,

672
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:07,082
and wearing the Stark soldier's
helmet falling over her head,

673
00:56:07,165 --> 00:56:08,791
and she just looks like
this little kid.

674
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:12,290
And now she's a grown woman,
and she's there watching again.

675
00:56:12,374 --> 00:56:13,874
But this time, she steps aside

676
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:15,224
to let a little kid come in
to watch

677
00:56:15,248 --> 00:56:17,165
'cause she remembers
how thrilling it was.

It's a whole new procession,
and so instead of Robert

679
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:22,791
arriving with Queen Cersei

680
00:56:22,874 --> 00:56:24,791

681
00:56:24,874 --> 00:56:27,332
it's Daenerys coming
with Jon Snow.

682
00:56:28,707 --> 00:56:29,749
I don't think the North

683
00:56:29,832 --> 00:56:31,432
is the most welcoming place
to outsiders.

684
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,998
Dany's smart. She senses
that distrust, and she's...

685
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:37,040
gonna make the best
of a bad situation,

686
00:56:37,123 --> 00:56:39,374
but that doesn't mean that
she likes it or she's happy.

687

When you're doing something good
for people,

688

and you get met
with what Sansa gives her

689
00:56:46,998 --> 00:56:48,183
when they meet in the courtyard,

690
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:50,290
it's understandable
that she would be upset.

691
00:56:51,957 --> 00:56:55,749
We've been with these characters
on a pretty regular basis

692
00:56:55,832 --> 00:56:57,832
all the time for the past
however many years.

693
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:00,082
The fact they're coming back
together again

694
00:57:00,165 --> 00:57:01,207
for the first time

695
00:57:01,415 --> 00:57:03,916
means more to them
than it may mean to us.

696
00:57:04,123 --> 00:57:05,499
Lady of Winterfell...

697
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,624
Has a nice ring to it.

698
00:57:09,332 --> 00:57:10,791
So does Hand of the Queen...

699
00:57:12,332 --> 00:57:14,165
depending on the queen,
I suppose.

700
00:57:14,332 --> 00:57:16,415
I think that if Tyrion were
to have shown up

701
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,415
on his own to Winterfell,
he would've gotten

702
00:57:18,499 --> 00:57:21,165
a much different reception
from Sansa than he did

703
00:57:21,374 --> 00:57:24,916
coming as the Hand of the Queen,
Daenerys Targaryen.

704
00:57:24,998 --> 00:57:27,457
There's also the specific thing
that happens in that scene,

705
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,290
which is Tyrion
has told everybody

706
00:57:29,374 --> 00:57:31,707
that the Lannisters are coming
to join the cause,

707
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:33,749
and it's amazing to her
that this person

708
00:57:33,832 --> 00:57:35,457
she thought was so smart
would ever

709
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,332
take Cersei at her word
on something like that.

710
00:57:38,415 --> 00:57:40,832
I used to think you were
the cleverest man alive.

How did you survive a knife

DAVID BENIOFF:
Jon Snow and Arya

714
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,957
are two of the most important
characters in the story,

715
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,290
and they love each other
very deeply.

716
00:57:54,624 --> 00:57:56,123
Arya was the only one
who treated Jon

717
00:57:56,207 --> 00:57:58,916
like a real member of the family
when he was a child,

718
00:57:58,998 --> 00:58:00,516
and he was the only one
who treated her

719
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,874
with the respect that she needed
when she was a kid.

720
00:58:03,123 --> 00:58:04,624
Jon has invited this...

721
00:58:05,207 --> 00:58:07,832
huge army of foreigners
into their home,

722
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:11,165
and Arya understands
why he did it,

723
00:58:11,248 --> 00:58:12,707
but Arya's on Sansa's side.

724
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:13,874
You are defending her.

725
00:58:15,123 --> 00:58:16,540
I'm defending our family.

726
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:19,457
So is she.

727
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:21,123
I'm her family too.

728
00:58:23,832 --> 00:58:24,832
Don't forget that.

729
00:58:25,082 --> 00:58:26,558
BENIOFF: Blood is definitely
thicker than water

730
00:58:26,582 --> 00:58:27,791
when it comes to Starks.

731
00:58:29,582 --> 00:58:30,582
Go on.

732
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:32,749
I don't know how to ride
a dragon.

733
00:58:33,457 --> 00:58:35,457
Nobody does
until they ride a dragon.

734
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:37,832
No one's ever ridden a dragon
except for Dany.

735
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,582
Only Targaryens
can ride dragons,

736
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:41,582
and that should be a sign
for Jon.

737
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:43,540
Jon's not always the quickest
on the uptake,

738
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:44,832
but eventually gets there.

739
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:48,832
We wanted to kind of re-anchor
their relationship.

740
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:51,248
It seemed important for it
to involve the dragons,

741
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:53,791
since the dragons play
such an important role.

742
00:58:54,123 --> 00:58:55,832
It's a major thing for her
when she sees

743
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,791
they have some kind
of connection to him,

744
00:58:57,874 --> 00:58:59,540
they allow him
to be around them.

745
00:58:59,624 --> 00:59:01,123
And when he flies up with her

746
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:03,540
and shows her where he used
to hunt as a kid,

747
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:05,957
I think she falls
even farther in love with him.

748
00:59:06,248 --> 00:59:08,499
Seeing Jon and Dany
on the dragons together,

749
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:12,040
it's a Jon and Dany moment,
but it also seeds in the idea

750
00:59:12,123 --> 00:59:17,290
that these creatures will accept
Jon Snow as one of their riders.

751
00:59:17,457 --> 00:59:18,582
Don't be afraid.

One of the challenges,

754
00:59:24,457 --> 00:59:26,540

of the exciting things

755
00:59:26,624 --> 00:59:28,582
about this episode,
this whole season,

756
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:30,666
is bringing together characters
who have never met.

757
00:59:30,832 --> 00:59:31,832
Sam has long been

758
00:59:31,998 --> 00:59:33,850
one of the more important
characters in the story.

759
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:35,832
But he's never seen
Queen Daenerys,

760
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,165
and yet they're connected
by various threads.

761
00:59:38,415 --> 00:59:39,558
The obvious one, which we know

762
00:59:39,582 --> 00:59:41,332
from the beginning of the scene,
is Jorah.

763
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:44,499
Sam saved him, and so Jorah
owes him this great debt.

764
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:47,415
What none of them realize
until midway through this scene

765
00:59:47,499 --> 00:59:49,791
is that they have another,
horrible connection.

766
00:59:49,874 --> 00:59:51,957
There are all these things
that you know

767
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,332
about those characters

768
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:55,165
that the other characters
don't know.

769
00:59:55,248 --> 00:59:57,374
And some of them
are very important.

770
00:59:57,457 --> 01:00:00,666
Dany murdered
Samwell's father and brother.

771
01:00:00,957 --> 01:00:02,582
That's a really complicated
thing for Sam

772
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:05,707
because he had a really fraught
relationship with his father.

773
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:08,165
Yet Sam's older brother
was not a bad person,

774
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:11,290
and died, really, quite bravely,
standing by his father's side.

775
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:13,957
John Bradley did
an excellent job.

776
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:17,123
The difference between
the way he takes the news

777
01:00:17,207 --> 01:00:19,123
of his father's death

778
01:00:19,332 --> 01:00:21,457
and the way he takes the news
of his brother's death,

779
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,415
it was a subtle thing
that he does

780
01:00:23,499 --> 01:00:24,874
with very few words.

781
01:00:26,499 --> 01:00:28,874
It's the kind of thing
that he could find out

782
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,332
in a number of different ways,

783
01:00:30,415 --> 01:00:33,374
but it seemed like
a very ineffective preamble

784
01:00:33,457 --> 01:00:35,332
and way into that later
moment.

785
01:00:36,707 --> 01:00:37,832
Daenerys...

786
01:00:38,957 --> 01:00:40,874
She executed
my father and brother.

787
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,290
I've executed men
who disobeyed me.

788
01:00:43,374 --> 01:00:44,791
You've also spared men.

789
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,582
Thousands of wildlings
when they refused to kneel.

790
01:00:47,957 --> 01:00:50,123
- I wasn't a king.
- But you were.

791
01:00:50,415 --> 01:00:53,707
The fact that Jon's real parents
were who Jon's real parents were

792
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:56,207
is not news to us at this point,
but what we don't know

793
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:59,332
is the way that Jon
is going to take this.

794
01:00:59,415 --> 01:01:00,998
How's the explosion
gonna look?

795
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,808
BENIOFF: Sam, as a brother
of the Night's Watch,

796
01:01:02,832 --> 01:01:06,207
and Jon are more brothers than
Bran and Jon ever really were.

797
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,415
He knows it's gonna hurt Jon

798
01:01:07,499 --> 01:01:09,998
and it's going to shatter
his whole worldview.

799
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:11,475
For all they know,
the Army of the Dead

800
01:01:11,499 --> 01:01:12,539
could attack the next day,

801
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:15,082
and someone has to tell Jon
before that.

802
01:01:15,874 --> 01:01:17,224
D.B. WEISS:
He's being told something

803
01:01:17,248 --> 01:01:21,248
that he both knows is true
and can't handle.

804
01:01:21,624 --> 01:01:24,248
So he tries to throw things
in front of it

805
01:01:24,332 --> 01:01:26,123
to prevent him
