   I'll give you one try, girl.

00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,306
       Kill me and you're free.

3
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,443
                But if I live,
                I'll break both
                your hands.

4

                 Go on, hit me.

5

                   Hit me hard.

 The truth is,
 you're lucky.

 You don't want to be
 alone out here, girl.

9

 Someone worse than me
 would find you.

10

            There's no one
            worse than you.

 (SCOFFS) You
 never knew my brother.

12

 He once killed
 a man for snoring.

13
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:19,214
 There's plenty
 worse than me.

14

 There's men who like
 to beat little girls,
 men who like to rape them.

15
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,588

 from some of them.

16

             You're lying.

17
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,209
 Ask her, if you ever
 see her again.

18
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:35,647
 Ask her who came back
 for her when the mob
 had her on her back.

19
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,085
 They would have
 taken her every which way

20
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,487
 and left her there
 with her throat cut open.

        Is that the Blackwater?

 The Blackwater?

23
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,182

 I'm taking you?

24
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,287
      Back to King's Landing,
      to Joffrey and the Queen.

25
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:01,939
 Fuck Joffrey.
 Fuck the Queen.

26
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:06,110
 That's the Red Fork.
 I'm taking you to the Twins.

27
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,615
                     But why?

28
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:14,386
 Your mother and
 brother will be there,
 and they'll pay me for you.

29

               Why would they
               be at the Twins?

 never told you?

      is yapping about it.

     Your uncle is marrying
     one of the Frey girls.

 bash my skull in,

 just make it there

 paying them well.

 Only by the broken
 swords on their banners.

42

               They're called
               the Second Sons.

       a Braavosi named Mero,
       the Titan's Bastard.

   Is he more titan
   or bastard?

 can explain to me
 how you propose to
 defeat us.

             or tomorrow,

196
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,011

         before this boy
         is put to the knife

197
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,349

         I'd counsel restraint.

198
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,686
           You came to hear me
           say it because you
           believe it yourself.

           slaughters innocents
           for gain or glory.

200

          he said to me,

    "I don't ever want to die."

        "You won't, child.
        You won't ever."

203
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:53,891
           I hated the idea
           of him lying awake
           in the dark, afraid.

268
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:24,879
 I suppose that's
 a different kind of prison.

269
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,366
 I just wanted to say...

270
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,502
 I'm just trying to say,
 very badly...

271
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,372
 I just...

272
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,992
 Just want to say
 I know how you feel.

273
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:43,931
            I doubt that
            very much, my lord.

274
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,903
 You're right.
 I have no idea
 how you feel.

275
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:52,439
 And you have
 no idea how I feel.

276
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:05,720
 But I promise you
 one thing, my lady.
 I won't ever hurt you.

277
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:12,192
      Do you drink wine?

278
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,663
                When I have to.

279
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:17,731
 Well, today you have to.

           radiant, Your Grace.

281
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,594
 Radiant? Why radiant?

282
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:31,795
           It's the word
           that came to mind.

283
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:32,963
    (CHUCKLES)

284
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:39,102
          We're going to
          be sisters soon.
          We should be friends.

285
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,672
 You're a musical girl,
 aren't you?

286
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,541
 I imagine you
 have a lovely voice.

287
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,244
          A better dancer than
          a singer, I'm afraid.

288
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,147
 But you know the song
 The Rains of Castamere?

289
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,384
        Of course. They play it
        so often here at court.

290
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,487
 So you know the story
 of House Reyne of Castamere?

291
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,655
            Not as well as you,
            I'm sure.

292
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,456
            (CHUCKLES)

293
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,493
       House Reyne was
       a powerful family.
       Very wealthy.

294
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,562
 The second wealthiest
 in Westeros.

295
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:10,051
 Aren't the Tyrells
 the second wealthiest
 family in Westeros now?

296
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:14,522
 Ambitious climbers
 don't want to stop
 on the second highest rung.

297
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,957
 If only you could
 take that final step,

298
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,210
 you'd see further
 than all the rest.

299
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,847
 You'd be alone with nothing
 but blue sky above you.

300
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,985
 So Lord Reyne built a castle
 as grand as Casterly Rock.

301
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:32,389
 He gave his wife diamonds
 larger than any
 my mother ever wore.

302
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:37,428
 And finally one day,
 he rebelled against
 my father.

303
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,763
 Do you know where
 House Reyne is now?

304
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:40,931
                  Gone.

305
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,900
         Gone.

306
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,371
 A gentle word.
 Why not say "slaughtered"?

307
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:53,977
 Every man, woman, and
 child put to the sword.

308
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,330
 I remember seeing
 their bodies hanging

309
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,632
 high above the gates
 of Casterly Rock.

310
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:04,087
 My father let them
 rot up there all summer.
 It was a long summer.

311
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:09,660
 "And now the rains
 weep o'er their halls,
 and not a soul to hear."

312
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,635
 If you ever call me
 "sister" again,

313
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,837
 I'll have you
 strangled in your sleep.

 As the father of the realm,
 it is my duty

318
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,145
 to give you away
 to your husband.

              Have you ever
              seen one like it?

331
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:55,869
 I've never seen
 anything like any
 of this. Not in my life.

       the first time you
       encounter real wealth?

333

 When I was your age,
 I lived on one
 bowl of stew a day.

334
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:07,447
 And stew is
 a kind word for it.

00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:10,517
              In Flea Bottom

     instead of the girl
     next to her in the tavern.

 mother because the Lord
 of Light willed it.

 have to say about that?

545
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,811
           You should ask them.

546
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:22,919
                   Why?

547
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,154
           We had philosophical
           differences.

548
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,656
 Over what?

549
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,257
                 Your beauty.

550
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,026
           It meant more to me
           than it did to them.

551
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:32,912
 You're a strange man.

      I'm the simplest man
      you'll ever meet. I only
      do what I want to do.

 supposed to impress me?

00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,236
                Yes.

555
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,307
 Why would I trust a man
 who murders his comrades?

556
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:47,259
                They ordered me
                to murder you.

557
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,761
            I told them
            I preferred not to.

558
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,264
               They told me
               I had no choice.

00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,183
          I saw him wink at me.

 He blinked.

             It would be easier

             if he had a name.
