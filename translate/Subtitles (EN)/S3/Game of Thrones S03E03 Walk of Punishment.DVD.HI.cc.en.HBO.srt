 EDMURE: If I may, nephew,

7
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,681
 I encountered a situation
 with one of my lieutenants

8
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,900
 at the Stone Mill which
 may have some bearing...

9
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:15,386
 Why don't you shut your mouth
 about that damned mill?

10
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,140
 And don't call him "nephew."
 He is your king.

11
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,640
    Robb knows
    I meant him no...

12
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,295
             You're lucky
             I'm not your king.

13
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,865
      I wouldn't let you
      wave your blunders around
      like a victory flag.

14
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,667
 My blunder sent
 Tywin's mad dog

15
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,571
 back to Casterly Rock
 with his tail
 between his legs.

16
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,973
 I think King Robb understands
 we won't win this war

17
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,642
 if he's the only one
 winning any battles.

18
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,025
 No, there's glory
 enough to go around.

19
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:39,928
         It's not about glory.

20
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:44,483
   Your instructions were to
   wait for him to come to you.

21
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:45,833
 I seized an opportunity.

22
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:47,953
       What value was the mill?

23
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,054
 The Mountain was garrisoned
 across the river from it.

24
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,756
         ROBB: Is he there now?

25
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,059
 Of course not.
 We took the fight to him.
 He could not withstand us.

26
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,363
              I wanted to
              draw the Mountain
              into the west,

27
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:02,434
     into our country,
     where we could
     surround him and kill him.

28
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,719
      I wanted him to chase us,

29
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:08,073
       which he would have done
       because he is a mad dog

30
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,241
           without a strategic
           thought in his head.

31
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,345
         I could have that head
         on a spike by now.

32
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,216
        Instead, I have a mill.

33

 We took hostages.
 Willem Lannister.
 Martyn Lannister.

34
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,893
    Willem and Martyn Lannister
    are 14 years old.

35
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,363
 Martyn is 15,
 I believe.

36

37
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,789
         Have I sued for peace?

38
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:42,590
           No.

39
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:46,828
          Do you think he'll
          sue for peace because
          we have his father's

40
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:49,748
     brother's great-grandsons?

41
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:55,971
          No.

42
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,956
     How many men did you lose?

43
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,161

 But for every man we lost,
 the Lannisters...

44

         What do we have, then?

68
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,487
        Robb Stark and
        most of his bannermen
        are in Riverrun

69
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:03,325
          for the funeral
          of his grandfather
          Lord Hoster Tully.

70
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:08,362
            In Stark's absence,
            Roose Bolton
            holds Harrenhal,

71
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:11,933

 for the widow Arryn.

       For which I am
       extremely grateful
       to you, my lord.

78
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,715

        have known each other
        since we were children.

79
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:32,837

      positively
      predisposed toward me.

80
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,506
           A successful
           courtship would make

81
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,109
 Lord Baelish
 acting Lord of the Vale.

 Titles do seem
 to breed titles.

83

 You'll leave for the Eyrie
 as soon as possible

84

 and bring Lysa Arryn
 into the fold.

 Then the young wolf
 can add his own aunt

 taken up arms against him.

88
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:57,212
          but Lord Baelish's
          absence would present
          certain problems.

 best suits your talents.

97
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,985
             I'm quite good

 when we were taken.

112
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,207
               I was in chains,

 hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

 "what a brilliant swordsman."

116

 than I expected.
 And more predictable.

117
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:15,957

118
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,692
             wrapped in chains,
             for the past year.

119
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,678
 I'm a woman.
 I was beating you.

120
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,013
       You were not beating me.

121
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,281
 Maybe you were as
 good as people said...

122
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,283
          Once.

123
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,420
 Or maybe people just
 love to over-praise
 a famous name.

124
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:37,696
     When we make camp tonight,
     you'll be raped.
     More than once.

125
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,665
          None of these fellows
          have ever been
          with a noblewoman.

126
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,219
                 You'd be wise
                 not to resist.
           Would I?

127
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,688
                They'll knock
                your teeth out.

128
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,122
 You think I care?

129
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,524
         No, I don't think you
         care about your teeth.

130
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:58,232
            If you fight them,
            they will kill you.
            Do you understand?

131
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,918
             I'm the prisoner
             of value, not you.

132
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,387
           Let them have
           what they want.
           What does it matter?

133
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,521
 What does it matter?

134
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,623
               Close your eyes.

135
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,258
         Pretend they're Renly.

136
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,596
 If you were a woman,
 you wouldn't resist?

137
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,898
 You'd let them do
 what they wanted?

138
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:19,236
   If I was a woman,
   I'd make them kill me.
   But I'm not, thank the Gods.

139
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:25,994
       If I had a proper forge,
       I'd make it good as new.

140
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:30,397
 Doesn't have to look pretty.
 It just has to keep
 the arrows out of my heart.

141
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,399
                   Why are you
                   helping him?

142
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,602
          He takes us prisoner,
          now he's our friend?

143
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,270
 THOROS: You're
 not our prisoner.

144
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,488
                 What am I?

145
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,623
   Our guest.

146
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,658
 No one's put
 any chains on you.

147
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,177
      So I can walk away, then?

148
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:45,046
 These woods aren't safe
 for Ned Stark's daughter.

149
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,398
 You're lucky we found you.

 you're good with that bow,
 you little twat?

 ANGUY: Better than
 anyone you've met.

152
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,611
      HOUND: A coward's weapon.
      I like to fight up close.

153
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,148
   I like to see a man's face
   when I put the steel in him.

154
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,751
 Why? So you can kiss him?

155
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,652
 You remember the last time
 you were here?

156
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,323
         Looks like every other
         shit inn on the road.

 but you're one ugly fucker

158
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:17,078
 and I'd rather
 not see you no more.

 We're about to leave.

165
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,863
           I'm staying.

166
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,602
                   You're what?

167
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,672
 I baked brown bread
 for the innkeep, she said
 she never had better.

168
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,126
 Told Thoros she's
 keeping me as payment
 for all his free meals.

169
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:52,713
      Anyway, it's not me
      the Brotherhood wants.
      My brother ain't no king.

170

00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,170
                  You sure?
        I'm sure.

173
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,525

                   It's a wolf.

                   Yes, it is.

   could almost be forgiven
   for forgetting we're at war.

188
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:34,649
         It often comforts me
         to think that even
         in war's darkest days,

189
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:40,071
 in most places in
 the world absolutely
 nothing is happening.

190
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,092
        I've missed you, Uncle.

191
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:48,929

        from the day you left.

192
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:51,249
         Maybe he never said it
         in so many words...

193
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,916
        Maybe?

194
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,269
 Your father was
 a stubborn old ox.

195
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:59,723
 I was surprised when
 he died. Didn't think
 death had the patience.

196
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:06,396
        I'm glad you were
        with him. I wish
        to the Gods I had been.

197
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,069
             Did you make peace
             in the end?

198
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:17,391
 After 30 years of fighting,
 I don't think he
 remembered what started it.

199
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,111
 He asked me to stop
 calling myself Blackfish.

200
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:26,917
 He said it was an old joke
 and it was never
 funny to begin with.

201
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:30,304
 I told him people
 had been calling me
 Blackfish for so long,

202
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:32,589
 they don't
 remember my real name.

203
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:40,581
        Every time he would
        leave for the capital
        or fight in a campaign,

204
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:43,868
               I'd see him off.

205
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,004
 "Wait for me, little Cat,"
 he'd say.

206
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:54,478
    "Wait for me,
    and I'll come back to you."

207
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:59,050
      And I would sit at this
      window every day when
      the sun came up, waiting.

208
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,921
                 I wonder,

209
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,758
             how many times
             did Bran or Rickon

210
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,061
       stare across
       the moors of Winterfell,

211
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,463
      waiting for me to return?

212

          again. (SOBBING)

216
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:33,918

               go on believing.

217
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:36,888
      He's got to remain strong
      if he's to prevail.

218
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,758

               Yes, my lord?

526

   After a long consultation
   with my colleague Ser Bronn,

527
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,760

              a suitable reward
              for the services

       above what might be
       considered reasonable.

      Tell me, Pod,
      have you ever
      been with a woman?

530
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,553
                   No, my lord.

531

   Wonderful.

     in first-timers.

         second-timers, either.

             They call it
             the Sapphire Isle.
             Do you know why?

654
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:19,869
     Every sapphire in Westeros
     was mined on Tarth.

655
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,539
       Sapphires are gemstones.

656

                 The blue ones.

          his daughter's weight

659
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,032
         in sapphires if
         she's returned to him.

660
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:39,338
       But only if she's alive,
       her honor unbesmirched.

667
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:01,927
 Unbesmirched.

668
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:05,697
              Not defiled.

669

 Fancy word for a fancy man.

670
00:48:09,703 --> 00:48:12,237
                I hated to read
                as a child,

671
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,007
        but my father forced me
        to study every morning

672
00:48:15,076 --> 00:48:17,910
        before I could practice
        with sword or horse.

673
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:21,781
            Two hours every day
            holed up in the

674
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:24,984
                I learned a lot
                of fancy words.

 Your father,
 he'd pay your weight
 in gold to get you back?

678

     You'll be a rich man
     till the end of your days.

679
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:49,024
     And your sons
     will be rich men,
     and their sons after them.

           You're a smart man.
           You understand that.

684
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:02,854
           We have the numbers.
           We have the gold.

685
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:04,956
 Aye, you have both.

             Fighting bravely
             for a losing cause
             is admirable.

687
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:16,468
   Fighting for a winning cause
   is far more rewarding.

 Hard to argue with that.

          to keep me
          chained to this tree?

              sleep lying down,

693
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:38,406
