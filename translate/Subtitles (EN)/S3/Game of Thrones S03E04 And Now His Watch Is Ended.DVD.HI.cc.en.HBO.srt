 Before all this nastiness,

46
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,698
 I was going to tell you
 the story of how I was cut.

47
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,083
 Do you want to hear it still?

48
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:38,086
            I don't know. Do I?

49
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:42,257
 As a boy, I traveled
 with a troupe of actors
 through the Free Cities.

50
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:44,793
 One day in Myr,

51
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:49,264
 a certain man made
 my master an offer
 too tempting to refuse.

52
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,632
 I feared the man
 meant to use me

53
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,868
 as I'd heard some men
 used small boys.

54
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,071
 But what he wanted
 was far worse.

55
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,509
 He gave me a potion
 that made me
 powerless to move or speak,

56
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,596
 yet did nothing
 to dull my senses.

57
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,399
 With a hooked blade
 he sliced me,

58
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,901
 root and stem,
 chanting all the while.

59
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,838
 He burned my parts
 in a brazier.

60
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:18,443
 The flames turned blue,
 and I heard
 a voice answer his call.

61
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,934
 I still dream of that night.

62
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:30,705
 Not of the sorcerer,
 not of his blade.

63
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,676
 I dream of
 the voice from the flames.

64
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:38,280
 Was it a god?
 A demon? A conjuror's trick?

65
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:40,882
 I don't know.

66
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,452
 But the sorcerer called
 and a voice answered.

67
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,641
 And ever since that day,
 I have hated magic and
 all those who practice it.

68
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,511
 But you can see why
 I was eager to aid in your

69
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,180
 fight against Stannis
 and his red priestess.

70
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,550
 A symbolic revenge of sorts.

71
00:06:58,619 --> 00:06:59,701
                       Yes.

73
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,990
         I feel the need for
         actual revenge against

74
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,760
       the actual person who
       tried to have me killed,

75
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,830
         which will require
         a degree of influence,
         which...

76
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,716
 You do not possess
 at the moment.

77
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:22,557
 But influence is
 largely a matter of
 patience, I have found.

78
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,610
        Once I had served
        the sorcerer's purpose,

79
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,579
             he threw me out of
             his house to die.

80
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,500
             I resolved to
             live to spite him.

81
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,469
 I begged.

82
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,555
        I sold what parts of
        my body remained to me.

83
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,175
   I became an excellent thief,

84
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:43,795
          and soon learned that
          the contents of
          a man's letters

85
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:47,682
 are more valuable
 than the contents
 of his purse.

86
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:53,054
       Step by step,
       one distasteful
       task after another,

87
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:57,959
   I made my way from
   the slums of Myr to
   the Small Council chamber.

88
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,948
 Influence grows like a weed.

89
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,252
 I tended mine patiently

90
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,823
 until its tendrils
 reached from the Red Keep

91
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:15,277
 all the way across to
 the far side of the world,

 to wrap them around

 to Deepwood Motte?

288
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,414
         BOY: Not far, my lord.

289
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,283
         Your sister is
         waiting for you there.

290
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,385
 She sent you to save me?
                         Yes.

291
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,587
            I served them,
            the men who
            were torturing you.

292
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,674
               I did what they
               told and waited.

293
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:50,260
 Why would you risk
 your life for me?

294
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,480
  I grew up on Saltcliffe,
  my lord.

295
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,349
       I was only a boy
       when they took you away.

296
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,418
    My father brought us
    up to the bluffs

297
00:18:58,487 --> 00:18:59,737
       so we could watch
       you carried off.

298
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,475
       I remember the look
       on my father's face
       when he told us,

299
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,844
    "That's Balon Greyjoy's
    last living son."

300
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,015
       And those are the words
       I heard over again

301
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,384
    when I saw what
    they were doing to you.

302
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:17,738
 Those men,
 they said my father knew
 what they were doing to me.

303
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,526
           Did he?

304
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:28,282
       I don't know, my lord.
       They...
       They never told me much.

 We don't need to
 hide from them.

308

         Not all those are
         your sister's men.

309
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,783
          Some of them are
          loyal to your father.

               BOY: What is it?

312
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,690
 I was just thinking
 how jealous I was

313
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,559
 when my father told Yara
 to take this place.

314
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,595
               What did he tell
               you to do?

315
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,663
 (CHUCKLES) Raid
 fishing villages.

316
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:03,818
 He didn't trust me.
 Thought I was a Stark.

317
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:06,253
 (LAUGHS) I could
 never be a Stark.

318
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:08,422
 Robb Stark always
 reminded me of that.

319
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:09,806
         He lorded it over you?

320
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,041
 Didn't have to.

321
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,844
 All he had to do was be.

322
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,683
 Be who he was born to be.

323
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,984
       His life fit him
       better than his clothes.

324
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,404
    How could someone like that
    ever be a brother to me?

325
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,673
    He's the King in the North.

326
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:27,174
                      And me...

327
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:30,711
       My father gave me
       a choice and I made it.

328
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:35,666
      I could never be a Stark.

329
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:40,371
         But ironborn, that's
         what I was born to be.

330
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,312
          I paid the iron
          price for Winterfell.

331
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,770

         living with a farmer.

335

     their throats and
     I let him burn the bodies,

336
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,479
     so I could keep Winterfell

337
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,866
      and make my father proud.

00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,854
 That she might have the most
 to contribute to your legacy

407
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:50,356
 that you love so much more
 than your actual children?

408
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:51,591
              (BLOWS)

409
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,033
         All right. Contribute.

410
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,955
 The Tyrells are a problem.

411
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:10,126
      The Tyrells helped us
      defeat Stannis Baratheon.

412
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,863
   The Tyrells saved your life,
   your children's lives.

413
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,967
   Margaery has
   her claws in Joffrey.

414
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,054
      She knows how to
      manipulate him.

415
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:24,107
         Good. I wish you knew
         how to manipulate him.

416
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,895
        I don't distrust you
        because you're a woman.

417
00:27:28,964 --> 00:27:32,298
         I distrust you because
         you're not as smart
         as you think you are.

418
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,035
        You've allowed that boy
        to ride roughshod

419
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:37,271
    over you and
    everyone else in this city.

420
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:48,182
 Perhaps you should try
 stopping him from
 doing what he likes.

421
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:54,121
                 I will.

422
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:58,558
 GIRL: Do you like it, Nana?

423
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:01,511
           Another golden rose.
           How original.

424
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,814
            I eat from plates
            stamped with roses.

425
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:06,183
        I sleep in sheets
        embroidered with roses.

426
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:09,152
     I have a golden rose
     painted on my chamber pot,

427
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,221
           as if that makes
           it smell any better.

428
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,906
        Roses are boring, dear.

429
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:15,659
              "Growing strong."

430
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:19,028
            Ha! The dullest
            words of any house.

431
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:23,016
          "Winter is coming!"
          Now that's memorable.

432
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:25,969
               "We do not sow."
               Strong. Strong.

433
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,920
             Those are houses
             you watch out for.

434
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:32,159
        Direwolves and krakens,
        fierce beasts.

435
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:34,928
              But a golden rose
              growing strong,

436
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:37,147
     (SCOFFS) that
     strikes fear in the heart.

437
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,801
            Look, little loves.

438
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,436
        A spider in the garden.

439
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:48,275
               Run along now.
               Grow strong.

440
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:52,479
         My lady.

441
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:56,016
 I wanted to personally
 welcome you to King's Landing.

442
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,418
 The city has
 been made brighter
 by your presence.

443
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,555
       The city is made
       brighter by my presence?

444
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:05,375
     Is that your usual line,
     Lord Varys?
     Are you here to seduce me?

445
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,177
 A little obvious, perhaps.

446
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:12,466
             Oh, no, please.
             Seduce away.
             It's been so long.

447
00:29:12,535 --> 00:29:15,101
          Though I rather think
          it's all for naught.

448
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:18,005
          What happens when
          the nonexistent bumps
          against the decrepit?

449
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:21,942
              A question for
              the philosophers.

450
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:24,761
    But you've come mincing
    all this way for something.

451
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,646
                         So?
     Might I sit?

452
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:27,831
                         No.

453
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,984
      Come, I've heard
      you're such a clever man.

454
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:34,370
          I'm curious why
          you've sought me out.

455
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,675
 You've taken
 an interest in Sansa Stark.

456
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,878
         Have I?
         Because I spoke to her
         once in this garden

457
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,831
   and one of your little spies
   came running to tell you?

458
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:46,933
     Why shouldn't I?
     She's an interesting girl.

459
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,518
      Is she?

460
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,020
          No, not particularly.

461
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:51,771
      But she's had
      an interesting childhood.

462
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,439
   She has, sadly.

463
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,177
 Well, forgive me for
 wasting your time, then.

464
00:29:57,246 --> 00:30:00,380
 I thought we shared
 certain hopes
 for her well-being.

465
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,884
   (CHUCKLING) Come, come.
   You surrender rather easily.

466
00:30:05,654 --> 00:30:07,354
                  Walk with me.

467
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:11,625
    I know the walls have ears,
    but apparently
    the shrubbery does, too.

468
00:30:11,694 --> 00:30:17,064
 I choose my allies
 carefully, and my enemies
 more carefully still.

469
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:19,165
          Which is Sansa Stark?

470
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,785
 Neither.
 A babe in the woods.

471
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:22,819
 I admired her father.

472
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:24,087
           Yes.

473
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,556
   Ned Stark had many admirers,

474
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:30,560
   and how many stepped forward
   when the executioner
   came for his head?

475
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,497
 I could not help Lord Stark.
 Perhaps I can
 help his daughter.

476
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,499
                     How?

477
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,135
 You're not the only one
 who has taken
 an interest in her.

478
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:43,306
      That's hardly surprising.
      She's a beautiful girl
      with a famous name.

479
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,776
 Indeed.
 She'd make a lovely match
 for the right suitor.

480
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,445
          It almost feels
          as if you're about to
          arrive at the point.

481
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,149
 Littlefinger is not
 long for the capital.

482
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,350
 A confidant of mine
 has told me that

483
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,120
 when he goes,
 Sansa Stark goes with him.

484
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,573
        And why have you come
        to me with this matter?

485
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:03,577
 Littlefinger was born
 with no lands,
 no wealth, no armies.

486
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:07,648
 He has acquired the
 first two. How long
 before he has the army?

487
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:10,784
 Perhaps you'll laugh,
 but I know him
 better than most,

488
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:13,537
 and this is the truth.

489
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,941
 Littlefinger is one of
 the most dangerous
 men in Westeros.

490
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,696
 If Robb Stark falls,
 Sansa Stark is
 the key to the North.

491
00:31:22,765 --> 00:31:25,565
         And if he marries her,
         he'll have
         the key in his pocket.

492
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,367
 Which seems such a shame.

493
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:29,402
 Why should a man with
 such a low reputation

494
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,855
 steal away such
 a lovely bride?

495
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:35,842
         You must despise him.
         You're working so hard
         to undermine him.

496
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,911
 Actually, I rather enjoy him.

497
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,947
 But he would see
 this country burn

498
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:43,449
 if he could be
 king of the ashes.

499
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,618
          You are a clever man,
          Lord Varys.

500
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:50,307
 You are too kind.
 I believe I have
 a possible solution.

501
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:52,976
        One doesn't need to
        be clever for that.
        It's obvious, isn't it?

502
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,873
 (CLEARS THROAT)

503
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:07,974
 I didn't mean
 to disturb you.

504
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:09,309
            You haven't.

505
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,412
 We'd like some privacy,
 please.

506
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:15,031
 If you wouldn't mind
 waiting back inside the keep.

507
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,069
 Or if you'd be kind enough
 to give me your names,

508
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,337
 I'll ask the King to
 speak with you himself.

509
00:32:25,827 --> 00:32:27,493
 What did you pray for?

510
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:28,762
              I can't tell you.

511
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:30,664
      Why not?

512
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:33,200
      I'll tell you
      what I prayed for
      in the Sept this morning.

513
00:32:33,268 --> 00:32:36,969
 Let's see,
 for my family's
 health and happiness,

514
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,139
 for an end to the war,
 for a short winter.

515
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:43,610
 Boring and traditional,
 I'm afraid. And you?

516
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,863
 I'm sorry, I just can't.

517
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:50,867
     MARGAERY: My cousin Alanna
     was the most beautiful
     girl I'd ever seen.

518
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:53,203
    When I was 12,
    I was all elbows and knees,

519
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,272
          and Alanna
          looked like a goddess
          sent to torture me.

520
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,541
 "Pig Face," she called me.

521
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,276
           (LAUGHS) "Pig Face"?
           That's ridiculous.

522
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,511
 It had something
 to do with my nose.

523
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,214
 Whenever she passed me
 in the halls, she'd oink.

524
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:05,615
            (OINKS)
                    (LAUGHS)

525
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,919
 So I prayed that
 she'd catch
 a horrible skin disease.

526
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,155
 A week after that,
 she came down
 with porridge plague.

527
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,623
 Porridge plague?

528
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,774
          Oh, you don't have it
          in the North?

529
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:17,610
         Your skin starts to
         look like boiled oats,

530
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,963
          and eventually,
          your face slides off
          and you die in agony.

531
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,581
 But that's awful.

532
00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:24,951
                    (LAUGHS)

533
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,619
 You're...

534
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:29,089
                I believed you!

535
00:33:29,158 --> 00:33:30,523
               Porridge plague.
               I'm an idiot.

536
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,293
 Don't say that.
 No, you're not.

537
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:35,628
               So what happened
               to Alanna?

538
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:37,798
 Oh, she grew up to be
 the most beautiful woman

539
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:40,617
 and married a handsome
 lord and they have
 darling children

540
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,452
         and live in
         a castle by the sea.

541
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,787
          It's all terribly
          frustrating.

542
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,024
 SANSA: I'm sure
 she's jealous of you now.

543
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,226
 You'll be married
 here in the capital,

544
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,162
 and she'll have
 to come watch and

545
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,779
 pretend to be happy
 that you're queen.

546
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:54,564
           (BOTH CHUCKLE)

547
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,719
       I want us to be friends,
       good friends.

548
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:02,239
 That would make me
 very happy.

549
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:08,562
       You must see Highgarden.
       You'd love it there.
       I know you would.

550
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,714
           We have a great
           masquerade the night
           of the harvest moon.

551
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,766
          You should see the
          costumes. People work
          on them for months.

552
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:19,606
 Uh, I don't think
 the Queen would let me
 leave King's Landing.

553
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:23,209
    The Queen Regent, you mean.
    Once I marry Joffrey,
    I'll be queen.

554
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:29,315
                And if you were
                to marry Loras,

555
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:35,455
              your place would
              be at Highgarden,
              wouldn't it?

556
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:40,710
           We would be sisters,
           you and I.
           Would you like that?

557
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:58,161
           His name was Bannen.

558
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,364
             He was a good man,
             a good ranger.

559
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,299
          He came to us from...

560
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,153
        Where did he come from?

561
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:08,721
     Down White Harbor way.

562
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:12,191
             He came to us
             from White Harbor.

563
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,294
     Never failed in his duty.

564
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,397
        He kept his vows
        the best he could.

565
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:21,701
 He rode far, fought fiercely.

566
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:27,240
 We shall never
 see his like again.

567
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:29,709
       ALL: And now
       his watch has ended.

568
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,729
   And now his watch has ended.

569
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,671
 Didn't think a broke
 foot could kill a man.

570
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,807
             It wasn't his foot
             that killed him.

571
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,393
          That bastard Craster
          starved him to death.

572
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:48,962
 Craster's got his
 daughters to feed.

573
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:50,763
         RAST: You on his side?

574
00:35:50,832 --> 00:35:54,267
     We can't just show up
     and steal all his food.

575
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:56,786
        We're brothers of
        the Night's Watch,
        not thieves.

576
00:35:56,855 --> 00:36:02,208
          The day we leave,
          Craster will tap
          a barrel of our wine,

577
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:05,428
                and sit down to
                a feast of ham
                and potatoes

578
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,198
          and laugh at us
          starving in the snow.

579
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:13,653
        He's a bloody wildling.

580
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,676
           Never knew Bannen
           could smell so good.

581
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,606
 You have one son,
 don't you, Mormont?

582
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,627
       I had my 99th.

583
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,747
    You ever meet
    a man with 99 sons?

584
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:47,337
     And more daughters
     than I can count.

 as they're gonna get.

    why don't you

592
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,888
    cut their throats
    and be done with it?

 you've not the stomach,
 and I'll sort them myself.

        there's nothing to eat.

00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,075

599
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,426
                There's sawdust
                in the bread.

600
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:32,765
 You don't like it,
 you go out there
 and eat the snow.

601
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:41,508
        I'd rather eat what
        you've got hidden away.

602
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:47,346
                  I told you to

668

 Ned Stark ordered me
 to execute your brother
 in King Robert's name.

             Ned Stark is dead.

         Aye.

681

688
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,595
          At the Mummer's Ford,
          girls of seven
          years were raped,

689
00:43:36,664 --> 00:43:40,132

 were cut in two while
 their mothers watched.

 and Princess Rhaenys
 before the Iron Throne.

694

 Do you take me for
 my brother? Is being
 born Clegane a crime?

 Murder is a crime.

           the Targaryen babes.

      never heard them bawling.

     You want to cut my throat,
     get on with it!

699

   But don't call me murderer
   and pretend that you're not.

700

         He was 12 years old.
         He was unarmed.
         And you rode him down.

703
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,259
           You slung him
           over your horse like
           he was some deer.

704
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,378
 Aye, he was a bleeder.

00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:29,815
             You don't deny
             killing this boy?

         HOUND: I was Joffrey's
         sworn shield.

707
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,369
 The boy attacked the prince.
                  That's a lie!

708
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:37,006
           I hit Joffrey.
           Mycah just ran away.

709
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:40,275
  Then I should have
  killed you. Not my place
  to question princes.

     What are you worth
     with a sword in your hand?
