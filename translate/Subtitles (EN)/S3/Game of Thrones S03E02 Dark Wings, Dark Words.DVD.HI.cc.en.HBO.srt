            you're safe enough.

138

    Meaning no offense,
    my lady, but (LAUGHS)
    I wouldn't tangle with you.

00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,412
       He doesn't.

143
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,915
      Maybe you're right.
      What if you're not?
      What if he tells someone?

144
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,386
 We're not doing it.

145
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,355
 He's an innocent man.

146
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,941
        More innocent than
        Lady Stark's daughters?

 Mmm. That's better.

 It makes you
 look very strong.

    Bring others.

             Yes, Your Grace.

      Bloody flowers.
      On the king.

 Looks like a Tyrell rose.
 Give it to Margaery
 for her wedding gown.

 than enough fabric.

 you think of her.

 She's an ideal match.

161
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:41,465
 With the Tyrells beside us,
 we'll crush the Northerners.

162

    Hang their lords,
    burn their strongholds,
    sow their fields with salt,

163
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:49,691
          and no one will think
          of rebelling for
          another century.

164

 It is a good match,
 but what do you think
 of her?

165

               She's beautiful
               and intelligent.

166
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,020
          Yes, she is.

    She married Renly Baratheon
    because she was told to.

          want anything.

 He just takes an interest
 because he loved my mother.

          A ponderous oaf.

00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:05,456
          His father was an oaf
          as well. My husband,
          the late Lord Luthor.

259
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:08,809
 He managed to ride off
 a cliff whilst hawking.

260
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:10,811
 They say he was
 looking up at the sky

261
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,381
 and paying no mind
 to where his
 horse was taking him.

262
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,267
     And now my son
     is doing the same,

263
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:20,054

 he's riding a lion
 instead of a horse.

           Now...

      I want you to
      tell me the truth

266
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:28,029
 about this royal boy,
 this Joffrey.

 You, you.
 Who else would know better?

269
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:39,924
 We've heard some
 troubling tales.
 Is there any truth to them?

270
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:45,262
 Has this boy mistreated you?
 Has he ripped out your tongue?

       fair and handsome

      and as brave as a lion.

273
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,423
 Yes, all Lannisters
 are lions.

274
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,226
 And when a Tyrell farts,
 it smells like a rose.

275
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,580
 But how kind is he?
 How clever?

276
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,681
 Has he a good heart,
 a gentle hand?

277
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:08,202
 I'm to be his wife.
 I only want to
 know what that means.

      Cheese will be served
      after the cakes, my lady.

 No need for that.

   Tell us the truth.
   No harm will come to you.

285
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:41,102
   My father always
   told the truth.

286
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:46,056
   Yes, he had that reputation.
   And they named him
   traitor and took his head.

           Joffrey.

288

        Joffrey did that.

289
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,947
      He promised
      he would be merciful

290
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:54,731
 and he cut my
 father's head off.

291
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,918
 And he said that was mercy.

292
00:18:56,986 --> 00:19:00,487
      Then he took me
      up on the walls
      and made me look at it.

 who ever lived.

365

 he didn't even know.

 all seven Gods,

368
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,962
              let the boy live.

       I'll be a mother to him.

371
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:46,607
         I'll beg my husband to
         give him a true name,

372
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,577
           to call him Stark
           and be done with it,

373
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:51,011
 to make him one of us.

374
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,581
                  And he lived.

375
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,316
 And he lived.

376
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,353

            keep my promise.

 all this horror
 that's come to my family,

           protect your people.

389

 Do you know what it
 takes to unite 90 clans,

390
00:24:56,028 --> 00:25:00,781
 half of whom want to
 massacre the other half
 for one insult or another?

 different languages
 in my army.

              The fellow with
              the bow is Anguy.

528
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:50,320
      No, who do you fight for?

529
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,954
 THOROS: The Brotherhood
 Without Banners.

530
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,307
         Now come along.

531
00:34:56,911 --> 00:35:01,864
    I want to hear how two boys
    and a very dangerous
    girl escaped Harrenhal.

532
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:04,884
       I'm not going with them.
       The Brotherhood?

533
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:07,386
        That's who the Mountain
        were looking for.

534
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:09,339
          They'll bring us back
          and put rats in us.

535
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,241
 You've got
 nothing to fear from us.

536
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,043
 The lords of Westeros
 want to burn the countryside.

537
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,146
 We're trying to save it.

538
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:20,266
 Now come on.
 We'll talk more over
 brown bread and stew.

539
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:22,368
 And then you can
 go on your way.

540
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:31,778
 ANGUY: Here's
 the thing, fat boy.

541
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:39,802
 When I'm done talking,
 that arrow's falling
 down on your fat head.

542
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,955
 So I advise you move,
 because I'm done talking.

543
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:51,531
         (MEN LAUGHING)

544
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,757
 Half the country's starving
 and look at this one.

545
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:05,028
          Maybe he's the reason
          half the country's
          starving.

546
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,255
                     My lion.

547
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,207
          We've spoken of this.

548
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:22,379
          You cannot come here.

549
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:28,467
 But you said I should come
 to you with any problems.

550
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:30,337
            Did anyone see you?

551
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,272
              No.
                      You sure?

552
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,907
             My father does not
             make idle threats.

553
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:37,944
    Having you killed would be
    the high point of his week.

554
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:39,846
            You have to be
            absolutely certain.

555
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:47,586
          All right.
          What is this problem?

556
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:51,590
 I'm worried about Sansa.

557
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,393
 When she spoke
 with Lord Baelish,

558
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,130
 his friend
 warned me about him.

559
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:59,098
                Baelish doesn't
                have friends.

560
00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:01,934
 I don't know her name.

561
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:03,519
          Oh, Ros? The redhead?

562
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,055
 How do you know her?

563
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,023
          I try to know as
          many people as I can.

564
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,941
         You never know
         which one you'll need.

565
00:37:09,711 --> 00:37:11,010
      She's a whore.

566
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:13,813
        Yes, well, we shouldn't
        be judgmental
        about these things.

567
00:37:13,882 --> 00:37:15,281
      You fucked her.

568
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,716
                   Oh, please.

569
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:19,802
        All right,
        yes, I fucked her once.

570
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:25,025
                  Twice.

571
00:37:25,093 --> 00:37:30,497
           But since I met you,
           my lady, I've been
           with no one else.

572
00:37:32,634 --> 00:37:35,234
 And was she good?
 Did you like her?

573
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:37,487
 Not as much as
 I like you, obviously,

574
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,639
 or she'd be the one
 torturing me right now.

575
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,828
 What did she say
 about Littlefinger?

576
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,083
           That Sansa
           shouldn't trust him.

577
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:54,220
 Is there
 an idiot in any village
 who trusts Littlefinger?

578
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,358
        We have to protect her.

579
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:01,210
       We can't.

580
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:06,015
 Now that the Lannisters
 have discarded her,
 Sansa will have many suitors.

581
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:09,369
 A great beauty
 with a very old name.

582
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:12,155
            A great beauty?
            Oh, a great beauty?

583
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,658
 Yes, she is,
 objectively, very.

584
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:19,812
 Her face is quite pleasing,
 to other men and to women,

585
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,714
 people in general.

586
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:23,432
 But not to me, of course.

587
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,020
 I only have eyes for you.

588
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:29,389
                You pervert.
                You want her?

589
00:38:29,457 --> 00:38:31,123
                    This child?

590
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:32,859
 I don't even want
 to talk about her.

591
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:34,226
                   But you are.

592
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:35,561
 Only because
 you're making me.

593
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,914
              (SCOFFS) I didn't
              force you to open

594
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,216
           your mouth and
           make words come out.

595
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:44,971
 This is cruel and unfair.
 Cruelly unfair.

596
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,341
       Aw! "The cruelty.
       Shae is so cruel to me."

597
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:52,378
        Mmm. Yes.

598
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,973
               Now do you think
               I'm cruel?

599
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,675
       Only if you stop.

600
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,348
 But you mustn't
 come here again.

601
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,653
       Do you hear me?

602
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,308
 You've come to a
 dangerous place (STAMMERS)
 full of dangerous people.

603
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:25,628
         (INHALES DEEPLY)

604
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,047
 Dangerous people. Mmm.

605
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:39,792
             (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
   GUARD: Lady Tyrell, my king.

606
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:41,360
 Send her in.

607
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:49,202
           (DOOR CLOSES)

608
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,595
            You wanted to
            see me, Your Grace?

609
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,329
        I'm leaving on
        a hunting trip.

610
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,717
 I just wanted to make sure
 you had everything
 you need before I left.

611
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:06,686
        That's very thoughtful,
        Your Grace.

612
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:08,587
       I have
       everything I could want.

613
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,456
 Good. Good.

614
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:12,925
    How are you finding
    life in the capital?

615
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,427
 It must be quite a change
 after Renly's camp.

616
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,213
             A welcome one.

617
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:21,951
        A military encampment
        is no place for a lady.

618
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,219
 And the bedside
 of a traitor?

619
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,958
 Is that a place for a lady?

620
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,360
                   Your Grace,

621
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,349
        I tried to do my duty
        as a wife, that is all.

622
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:39,835
 What was your duty to
 this traitor as you saw it?

623
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:43,806
     The duty of any wife
     to any husband. To
     provide him with children.

624
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,342
 You failed to do this.

625
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,278
           Why?
                        I...

626
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,900
              I would not speak
              ill of the dead.

627
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:56,735
 You think one
 ought to speak kindly
 of a traitor

628
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,721
 'cause he had a sword
 put through his heart?

629
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,626
      No. I do beg your pardon.

630
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:07,062
              The subtleties of
              politics are
              often lost on me.

631
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,798
                   Renly...

632
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:16,122
       I don't believe
       he was interested
       in the company of women.

633
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:19,475
 What makes you say this?

634
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:25,565
         Whenever I wanted to
         make a child with him,
         he...

635
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,803
       He had so many excuses,
       so many
       late-night war councils.

636
00:41:32,206 --> 00:41:34,340
        He never wanted to try.

637
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:38,444
            Except one evening,

638
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:43,365
      after he'd had far
      too much wine to drink,
      he suggested something...

639
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,755
           Something that
           sounded very painful

640
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,474
          and couldn't possibly
          result in children.

641
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,446
   Maybe the fault was with me.

642
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:01,083
 No, he was
 a known degenerate.

643
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,537
            It's such a relief
            to hear you say so,
            Your Grace.

644
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,238
       Mmm.

645
00:42:06,307 --> 00:42:10,926
 I've considered
 making his perversion
 punishable by death.

646
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,263
              As is your right.

647
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,202
       You must do
       whatever you need to do.

648
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:24,256
              You are the king.

649
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,525
         Yes.

650
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,997
         I am.

651
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:38,504
 Do you like it?

652
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:41,573
 I just had it made.
 Probably one of

653
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,492
 the finest weapons
 in the Seven Kingdoms.

654
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,944
      It's beautiful. Will
      you show me how it works?

655
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:55,354
 It's a new design.
 Much easier to load.
 There's no crank.

656
00:42:55,422 --> 00:42:59,208
 You use this lever
 to draw the string.

657
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,348
 The bolt goes here.

658
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,438
 And then you just aim...

659
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,859
       And...

660

795
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:16,638
             ALL: Yeah!

796
00:51:19,126 --> 00:51:20,793
       Girl.

797
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:26,532
          What in seven hells
          are you doing
          with the Stark bitch?

798
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:39,962
              JAIME: It's
              a tough decision.

799
00:51:40,031 --> 00:51:43,966
      Take the bridge
      and risk being seen
      or cross the great water.

800
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:45,267
 BRIENNE: Silence.

801
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:46,818
              Anyone can see us
              on the bridge,

802
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:49,755
 but cross by water
 and the current
 could take us.

803
00:51:49,823 --> 00:51:51,623
 Or I could
 escape down the river.

804
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,458
                    Good luck.

805
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,731
 It's wonderful to watch you
 wrestle with these dilemmas.

806
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,000
 Which will she choose?

807
00:52:06,974 --> 00:52:10,208
         Gambler at heart.
         Wouldn't have guessed.

808
00:52:10,277 --> 00:52:12,277
 Be quick about it.

809
00:52:18,953 --> 00:52:20,685
            Oh, I need to rest.
           Get up.

810
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:23,322
              I have these,
              on your feet when
              you walk too far.

811
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:24,806
         What do you call them?
         Get up now.

812
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,976
             Corns. I never
             used to get corns.

813
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:31,881
     I used to ride everywhere,
     not march around like
     a common foot soldier

814
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:34,266
         wearing the same shit
         boots for over a year.

815
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:36,868
           This heel is ruined.
           There's no way...

816
00:52:36,937 --> 00:52:38,153
               (GRUNTS)

817
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:44,793
                     (CHUCKLES)

818
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:46,628
             I never understood
             why some knights

819
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:48,430
              felt the need to
              carry two swords.

820
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:51,966
                (EXHALES)

821
00:53:03,163 --> 00:53:04,162
                 Ooh!

822
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:11,003
            You move well

823
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:16,175
 for a great beast of a woman.

824
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:18,109
        (GRUNTING)

825
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:24,300
 You shouldn't
 grimace before you lunge.
 It gives away the game.

826
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:42,734
     Bit of a quandary for you.
     If you kill me,
     you fail Lady Stark.

827
00:53:43,871 --> 00:53:46,087
      But if you don't kill me,

828
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:48,207
         I'm going to kill you.

829
00:53:54,581 --> 00:53:58,033
 You're good.
 Graceless, but good.

830
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:11,296
 See? If you were
 willing to hurt me,
 you might have had me there.

831
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,348
             (GROANS)

832
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,346
       (JAIME PANTING)
         (HORSE NEIGHING)

833
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,048
        (HORSES APPROACHING)

834
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:57,993
  Looks like your woman's
  getting the better of you,

835
00:54:58,062 --> 00:54:59,911
        if you can call
        that a woman.

836
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,583
 We enjoy a good fight.
 Gets our juices flowing.

837
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:09,038
 The Flayed Man
 of House Bolton.
 A bit gruesome for my taste.

838
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:11,389
       You sure he's the one?

839
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,092
 That's him, all right.

840
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,194
 I saw him fight at
 the tourney for
 Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

841
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:20,465
     Give the man
     his silver.

842
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:25,104
 Let us go and
 my father will pay you
 whatever you want.

843
00:55:25,172 --> 00:55:27,856
 Enough to buy me a new head?

844
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,826
 If the King in the North
 hears I let
 the Kingslayer go,

845
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:33,562
     he'll be
     taking it right off.

846
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,147
   I'd rather he takes yours.
