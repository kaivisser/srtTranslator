       Tywin's castle from him,

 the perfect castle for us.

139
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:48,656
 It's got a secret sally port,
 the Black Gate,
 as old as the Wall itself.

00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:52,476
 No one's used it
 in centuries, most likely.

 It leads through
 the Wall right down
 into the Nightfort,

 which, it just so happens,
 (CHUCKLES) I do.

 seem strange from

 Without the bedding ceremony,
 there's no real proof

 the lord and lady

            No, but there
            are other ways
