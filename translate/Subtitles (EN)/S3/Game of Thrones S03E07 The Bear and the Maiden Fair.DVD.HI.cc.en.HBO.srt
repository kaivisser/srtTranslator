              all I ever wanted
              was to escape,

140
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:29,387
                to come here
                to the capital.

141
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,856
       See the southern knights
       and their painted armor

142
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,459
             and King's Landing
             after dark.

143
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,664
             All the candles
             burning in
             all those windows.

144
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,969
                 I'm stupid.

145
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,457
         A stupid little girl
         with stupid dreams
         who never learns.

146
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:50,792
             Come on.

147
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:54,729
 Come walk with me.

148
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,101
 I remember the first time
 I saw you in the throne room.

149
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:03,505
 I'd never seen anyone
 who looked so unhappy.

150
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:07,575
 I want very much for
 you to be happy, Sansa,
 and so does my grandmother.

151
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,347
 You would have been
 happy at Highgarden,

152
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:17,868
 but women in our position
 must make the best
 of our circumstances.

153
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,940
         How do I make the best
         of my circumstances?
         I have to marry him.

154
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:27,094
 Has Lord Tyrion
 mistreated you?

155
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,162
                 No.

156
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:30,031
 Has he been kind to you?

157
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,034
               He's tried.

158
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:34,668
 You don't want him,
 though.

159
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:35,937
              He's a Lannister.

160
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,539
 Far from the worst Lannister,
 wouldn't you say?

161
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:45,029
          I'm sorry. Here I am
          complaining to you...

162
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,264
 My son will be king.

163
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,735
 Sons learn from their
 mothers. I plan to
 teach mine a great deal.

164
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,122
 And your son,
 if I'm not mistaken,

165
00:12:55,191 --> 00:13:00,077
 your son might be
 the Lord of Casterly Rock
 and the North someday.

166
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:03,697
 What?

167
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,985
                  My son...

168
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,120
                     With him.

169
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,541
                I'll have to...

170
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:15,910
              We'll have to...

171
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:17,778
 If it's the pain
 you're worried about...

172
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:22,350
          I'm not afraid of the
          pain. Not after what
          Joffrey's done to me.

173
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:23,685
 What is it, then?

174
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,692
 He's rather good-looking,
 even with the scar.
 Especially with the scar.

175
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,825
               He's a dwarf.

176
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:34,828
                   And Loras...

177
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,030
                   Loras.

178
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:44,322
 Some women like tall men.
 Some like short men.

179
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,957
 Some like hairy men.
 Some like bald men.

180
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:52,396
 Gentle men, rough men,
 ugly men, pretty men,
 pretty girls.

181
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,700
 Most women don't know
 what they like
 until they've tried it.

182
00:13:55,768 --> 00:14:00,989
 And, sadly, so many of us
 get to try so little
 before we're old and gray.

183
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:07,594
 Tyrion may surprise you.
 From what I've heard,
 he's quite experienced.

184
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,799
       And that's a good thing?

185
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,501
 It can be.

186
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:16,537
 We're very complicated,
 you know.
 Pleasing us takes practice.

187
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,241
      How do you know all this?

188
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:21,976
      Did your mother
      teach you?

189
00:14:25,248 --> 00:14:27,982
           Yes, sweet girl.
           My mother taught me.

190
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:33,371
         TYRION: She's a child.

191
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,972
 BRONN: She's a foot
 taller than you.

192
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,175
            A tall child.

193
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,992
 What's the youngest
 you've ever had?

194
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:40,495
              Not that young.

195
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:42,029
 How much older?

196
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,565
                   Older.

197
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:48,436
 You're a lord, she's a lady.

198
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:51,205
 And a beauty, at that.
 I don't see the problem.

199
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:53,407
             Shae isn't going
             to like it.

200
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,275
 Shae is a whore.

201
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:58,145
 Are you gonna
 marry her, eh?

202
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:01,399
 How did marrying
 a whore work out for you
 the first time?

203
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:04,134
           I should never have
           told you about that.

204
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,638
 You want Shae, keep her.
 Wed one and bed the other.

205
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,674
 All you have to do
 is get a son in
 the Stark girl.

206
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,577
 He'll be Lord of
 Winterfell one day.

207
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,829
 You can rule
 the North in his name.

208
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:17,565
 You'll have two women
 and a whole kingdom
 of your own.

209
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:21,619
        Two women to despise me
        and a whole kingdom
        to join them.

210
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,824
 You waste time trying
 to get people to love you,

211
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:29,527
 you'll end up
 the most popular
 dead man in town.

212
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,129
 (BRONN CHUCKLES)

213
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:35,316
 You want to fuck
 that Stark girl.

214
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:38,553
 You just don't
 want to admit it.

215
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:42,456
       I don't pay you to put
       evil notions in my head.

216
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,992
         The ones already there
         don't need company.

217
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:47,895
 You pay me to kill
 people who bother you.

218
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:52,166
 Evil notions come free.

219
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,809
           (DOOR CLOSES)

220
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,117
                    Your Grace.

221
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,285
    Grandfather.

222
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,372
                  You wanted to
                  speak to me?

223
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,007
        Yes.

224
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:37,311
 I'd like
 a report on the meetings
 of my Small Council.

225
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,247
            You're welcome to
            attend the meetings

226
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:41,432
         of your Small Council,
         Your Grace.

227
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,667
            Any or all of them.

228
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,535
 I've been very busy.

229
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,187
 Many important matters
 require a king's attention.

230
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,556
                  Of course.

231
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,893
 You've been holding
 the council meetings

232
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:56,597
 in the Tower of the Hand
 instead of
 the Small Council chamber.

233
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,132
                   I have, yes.

234
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:01,652
      May I ask why?

235
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,489
    Well, the Tower of the Hand
    is where I work.

236
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:07,392
          To walk from there to
          here would take time,

237
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,278
         time I could otherwise
         spend productively.

238
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:12,647
 So if I wanted to
 attend a council meeting,

239
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:16,667
 I would now have to
 climb all the stairs in
 the Tower of the Hand?

240
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,901
           We could arrange
           to have you carried.

241
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:43,527
 Tell me about
 the Targaryen girl in
 the east and her dragons.

242
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,062
               Where did you
               hear about this?

243
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,330
       Is it true?

244
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,233
                 Apparently so.

245
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:55,273
 Don't you think we ought
 to do something about it?

246
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,894
          When I was Hand of
          the King under your
          father's predecessor,

247
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:05,816
        the skulls of all
        the Targaryen dragons
        were kept in this room.

248
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:11,505
        The skull of the last
        of them was right here.

249
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:14,709
   It was the size of an apple.

250
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:19,297
 And the biggest was
 the size of a carriage.

251
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:25,353
          Yes, and the creature
          to whom it belonged
          died 300 years ago.

252
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:29,089
      Curiosities on
      the far side of the world
      are no threat to us.

253
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:32,676
 But how do we know
 these dragons are
 just curiosities

254
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,813
 and not the beasts
 that brought
 the whole world to heel?

255
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,749
    Because we have been told
    as much by the many experts

256
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,851
         who serve the realm
         by counseling the King

257
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,919
        on matters about
        which he knows nothing.

258
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,706
 But I haven't been counseled.

259
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:48,809
        You are being counseled
        at this very moment.

260
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,332
 I should be consulted
 about such things.

261
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,950
               From now on,
               I will see to it
               that you are

262
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,570
        appropriately consulted
        on important matters

263
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,139
            whenever necessary.

264
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,730
                    Your Grace.

265
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,380
       Yunkai.
       The Yellow City.

266
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,356
   BARRISTAN: The Yunkish train
   bed slaves, not soldiers.
   We can defeat them.

267
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,611
       On the field, with ease.
       But they won't
       meet us on the field.

268
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,964
          They have provisions,
          patience,
          and strong walls.

269
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:46,617
       If they're wise, they'll
       hide behind those walls

270

 something in return.

    (SOBBING) Please.

540
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:06,486
 No. No! Mercy, please!
 Please, mercy! Mercy!

541
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:08,621
                 This is mercy.

542
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,007
           I'm not killing you.

543
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:15,361
             Just making
             a few alterations.

00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:22,051
 No! No! No! Please, no! No!

 No! No, please! Please!

546

 (WHISPERS) You're
 gonna scare it off.

547
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:32,378
 (WHISPERS) I'm
 not gonna scare it.
 I'm gonna kill it.

548
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:35,714
             It's too far away.

549
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,590
     YGRITTE: Is that a palace?

550
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,444
               It's a windmill.

551
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,981
                      Windmill.

552
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,567
 Who built it? Some king?

553
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,553
             Just the men who
             used to live here.

554
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:18,157
 YGRITTE: They must have
 been great builders,
 stacking stones so high.

555
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,227
         Winterfell has towers
         three times that size.

556
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,746
          "Oh, I'm Jon Snow and
          I'm from Winterfell.

 "My daddy was a fancy lord

558
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,751
 "and I lived in a tower
 that touched the clouds."

559
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,020
            If you're impressed
            by a windmill,
            you'd be swooning

560
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,606
      if you saw the Great Keep
      at Winterfell.

561
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:35,541
 What's swooning?

562
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,026
                  Fainting.

563
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,328
 What's fainting?

564
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,501
           When a girl sees
           blood and collapses.

565
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,402
 Why would a girl see
 blood and collapse?

566
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:47,519
                       Well...

567
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,257
    Not all girls are like you.

        (CHUCKLES)

569
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,943
 Well, girls see
 more blood than boys.

570
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,565
 Or do you like girls
 who swoon, Jon Snow?

571
00:41:59,634 --> 00:42:03,635
 (GASPS) Oh, a spider!
 Save me, Jon Snow.

572
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:08,507
          My dress is made
          of the purest silk
          from Tralalalaleeday.

573
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:10,376
 I'd like to see
 you in a silk dress.

574
00:42:13,148 --> 00:42:14,380
 Would you?

575
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,753
    So I could tear it off you.

576
00:42:20,822 --> 00:42:25,174
 Well, you rip
 my pretty silk dress,
 I'll blacken your eye.

577
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,684
 Maybe one day I'll
 take you to Winterfell.

578
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:39,088
           Or maybe one day
           I'll take you there.

579
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:41,474
           After we've
           taken our land back.

00:42:45,113 --> 00:42:46,229
      Ygritte.

581
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,100
   You won't win.

582
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,572
 I know your people are brave,
 no one denies that.

583
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,156
            You know nothing...

584
00:42:57,225 --> 00:42:58,691
 Six times in
 the last thousand years,

585
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:01,294
 a King-beyond-the-Wall
 has attacked the kingdoms.

586
00:43:01,363 --> 00:43:02,961
 Six times they failed.

587
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:04,596
      And how do you know that?

588
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,300
 Every boy in
 the North knows it.
 We grow up learning it.

589
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:11,170
 Where the battles
 were fought, the heroes,
 who died where.

590
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:16,008
 Six times you've invaded
 and six times you've failed.

591
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:18,561
 The seventh
 will be the same.

592
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,195
            Mance is different.

593
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,764
 You don't have
 the discipline.

594
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:25,534
 You don't have the training.
 Your army is no army.

595
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,702
 You don't know how
 to fight together.

596
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,819
           You don't know that.

597
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:29,088
        I do.

598
00:43:29,924 --> 00:43:31,457
    I know it.

599
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:35,394
 If you attack the Wall,
 you'll die. All of you.

600
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:45,488
                 All of us.

601
00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:05,291
      You're mine as I'm yours.

602
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,794
         And if we die, we die.

603
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,097
          But first we'll live.

604
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:16,085
 Yes, first we'll live.

      (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

606
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:35,387
                What's he
                going on about?

607
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:39,525
    And how come he
    always gets to sit and chat
    while we do all the work?

609
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,816
           That's where we are.
   What are
   you telling him?

610
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,804
          It's all right, Osha.
            It's not all right.

611
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,256
            You think I can't
            hear you every day?

612
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:55,274
              Filling his head
              with black magic.

613
00:44:55,343 --> 00:44:58,010
          Talking about visions
          and three-eyed
          ravens and worse.

614
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,244
        Leave him alone.

615
00:44:59,314 --> 00:45:01,347
      He can speak for himself.

616
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:02,915
 I don't fill his
 head with anything.

617
00:45:02,984 --> 00:45:05,384
             OSHA: So, what
             do you talk about?

618
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,337
 What's happening to him
 and what that means.

619
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:11,007
         Go on, then.
         Tell us what it means.

620
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,741
   It's not like that.

621
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:16,079
 I wish I could tell
 him all the answers.
 It would be much easier.

622
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,248
 I don't want you
 talking to him anymore.

623
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,166
 Until we get to your
 brother at Castle Black.

624
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:22,684
 We're not going
 to Castle Black.

625
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,370
              What did you say?

626
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:26,939
 I told you already.
 Jon Snow isn't there.

627
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:29,491
 Bran needs to find
 the raven beyond the Wall.

628
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,260
             Oh, no. I'm not
             going back there.

629
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,845
      Your brother is
      at Castle Black.
      That's where we're going.

630
00:45:36,084 --> 00:45:37,800
                    Look at me.

631
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,406
 The raven's been coming
 to me ever since I fell
 from that tower.

632
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,574
 He wants me to find him.

633
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,778
 I don't have my legs anymore.

634
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:51,848
 This is what I have now.

635
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:55,734
           You have a family.
           You need to go
           back to Castle Black

636
00:45:55,803 --> 00:45:58,403
        so you can get back to
        them, where you belong.

637
00:45:58,472 --> 00:46:01,490
 What if I belong
 in the North?

638
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:06,295
 What if I fell from
 that tower for a reason?

639
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:10,365
         Is that what he's
         telling you? That
         it's all for a reason?

640
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:15,170
      All these bad things
      happened because the Gods
      got big plans for you?

641
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,772
           I wish it were true,
           little lord.

642
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:20,626
    But the Gods wouldn't spare
    a raven's cold shit
    for you or me or anyone.

643
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,979
 You don't understand.
 You don't know.

644
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:25,047
              You don't know.
              None of you know.

645
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,083
            None of you
            have been up there.

646
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:34,457
              I had a man once.
              A good man.

647
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:38,810
     Bruni, his name was.
     I was his and he was mine.

648
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:41,847
              But one night
              Bruni disappears.

649
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,451
        People said he left me,
        but I knew him.

650
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,055
           He'd never leave me.
           Not for long.

651
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,675
 I knew he'd come back.

652
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:55,711
      And he did.

653
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:00,583
 He came in through
 the back of the hut.

654
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:05,354
 Only it wasn't Bruni.
 Not really.

655
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:12,294
 His skin was pale
 like a dead man's.

656
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,864
 His eyes bluer
 than clear sky.

657
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:26,592
 He came at me,
 grabbed me by the neck
 and squeezed so hard

658
00:47:26,661 --> 00:47:29,061
 I could feel
 the life slipping out of me.

659
00:47:31,966 --> 00:47:34,216
 I don't know how
 I got the knife.

660
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:39,354
 When I did, I stuck it
 deep into his heart.

661
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,160
 And he hardly
 seemed to notice.

662
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:51,133
 I had to burn our hut
 down with him inside.

663
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:56,672
        I didn't ask
        the Gods what it meant.

664
00:47:56,741 --> 00:48:00,509
              I didn't need to.
              I already knew.

665
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:05,464
        It meant the North was
        no place for men to be.
        Not anymore.

666
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:11,704
 I promised your maester
 I'd get you to Castle
 Black and no further.

667
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,898
 QYBURN: How is
 the pain, my lord?

668
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:29,004
          What's the purpose of
          an arm with no hand?

669
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:35,844
 Well, we've stymied
 the corruption.

670
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,830
             Yes, we've stymied

              one boy too many?

688
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:38,740
            and had them carted
            back to your garret
