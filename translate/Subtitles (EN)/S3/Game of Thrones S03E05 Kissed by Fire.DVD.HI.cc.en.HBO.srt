00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,364
        Take this away.

139
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:04,715
         Send it to his father?

140
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,568
 You'll hold your tongue
 unless you want to lose it.

141
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:09,020
 Cut her free.

142
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,507
 Apologies, my lady.
 You're under
 my protection now.

143
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,460
        Thank you, my lord.

144
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,331
 Find suitable rooms
 for our guests.

145
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,884
 We'll speak later.

146
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,037
                  Lord Bolton.

147
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,959
              Is there word
              from the capital?

148
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:34,745
 You haven't heard?

149
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,050
 Stannis Baratheon laid siege
 to King's Landing.

150
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:44,639
 Sailed into Blackwater Bay.
 Stormed the gates
 with thousands of men.

151
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:47,725
 And your sister...

152
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,082
 How can I put this?

153
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,170
     Your sister...

154
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:02,957
 Is alive and well.

155
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:05,176
 Your father's
 forces prevailed.

156
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,180
 Ser Jaime isn't well.
                     (GROANING)

157
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,516
      Take him to Qyburn.

158
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,219
           (GROANING CONTINUES)

159
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,415
 (JAIME GROANS)

160
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:32,152
       Will I die?

161
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:33,488
                           No.

162
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:36,891
    The corruption has spread.
    I fear it must be cut away.

163
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,027
             The safest course
             would be to take
             the whole arm off.

164
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:41,929
 Then you'll die.

165
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,934
 You're no maester.

166
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:48,669
 Where's your chain?

167
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:51,472
             The Citadel
             stripped me of it.

168
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:56,661
              They found some
              of my experiments
              too bold.

169
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,398
    I can leave your upper arm,
    make the cut at your elbow.

170
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,633
 I don't need
 my right hand to kill you.

171
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,721
              I can take away
              the rotting flesh

172
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,292
             and try and burn
             out the corruption
             with boiling wine.

173
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,727
 Mmm. (CLEARS THROAT)

174
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,396
             With any luck,
             that will suffice.

175
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:17,298
             You'll need
             milk of the poppy.

176
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,633
 No milk of the poppy.

177
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:20,818
            There will be pain.

178
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,603
            I'll scream.

179
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,871
           Quite a bit of pain.

180
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,940
        I'll scream loudly.

181
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,016
      (GROANS)

182
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,807
 (GROANS)

183
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,274
 (BREATHING HEAVILY)

184
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,515
          (GROANS)

185

             (SCREAMING)

186
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,627
          CERSEI: Lord Baelish.

187
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,061
     Your Grace.

188
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,730
           I wonder if I might
           ask you for a favor.

189
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,548
 Of course, Your Grace.

190
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:10,951
 I believe that House Tyrell
 don't hold the crown's
 best interests at heart.

191
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,690
        I see. And have you
        shared these suspicions
        with Lord Tywin?

192
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,375
 My father's a practical man.
 He appreciates facts.

193
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:20,995
         Myself, I often
         find them a hindrance.

194
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:24,231
 And he appreciates
 those who aid his family,
 as you well know.

195
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,651
 He's almost as generous
 to those who help us

196
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,002
 as he is unpleasant
 towards those who don't.

197
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,505
 You have a good
 working relationship
 with the Tyrells.

198
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,575
 I thought you might
 look into it before
 you leave the capital.

199
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:36,577
            I shall do my best.
 Thank you.

200
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:38,445
 And your best will
 prove better than

201
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:40,280
 when I asked you to
 locate Arya Stark?

202
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,932
     I assure you that it will.

203
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,759
 Gods, boy, that's enough.
 We're not in a tavern.

204
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:53,077
         Pardon, my lady.
 No need to speak.

205
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,262
 Are there any figs?
 Fetch some.

206
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,384
 I always take
 figs midafternoon.
 They help move the bowels.

207
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,068
 To what do I owe
 this summons?

208
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:03,137
            Thank you for
            seeing me, my lady.

209
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:05,356
   I had hoped we might discuss
   a few financial matters.

210
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:09,109
 I climbed all those steps
 to discuss financial matters?

211
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,828
        It's the royal wedding.
        I'm told you had
        a hand in planning it.

212
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,531
 Naturally.

213
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,882
        It's shaping up to be
        a very involved affair.

214
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,685
         The word "extravagant"
         has been used.

215
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:19,453
 What good is
 the word "extravagant"

216
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:21,956
 if it can't be used
 to describe a royal wedding?

217
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:23,874
             I understand that.
       Good.

218
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,010
        But, as Master of Coin,
        it falls upon me

219
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,061
        to calculate
        the cost for the crown.

220
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,664
           As of now,
           it's a huge expense.

221
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,433
        And?

222
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:35,653
              And we're at war,
              Lady Olenna.

223
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:37,972
 Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.

224
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,574
                And maintaining
                supply lines...

225
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,175
 I can't think how
 it slipped my mind.

226
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:45,562
 What is it, 12,000
 infantrymen the Tyrell
 family has supplied?

227
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:50,150
 1,800 mounted lances.
 2,000 in support.

228
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:53,154
 Provisions, so this city
 might survive the winter.

229
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,655
 A million bushels of wheat.

230
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:58,326
 Half a million bushels each
 of barley, oats, and rye.

231
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:01,696
 20,000 head of cattle.
 50,000 sheep.

232
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:04,264
 You don't have to lecture me
 about wartime expenses.

233
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,216
 I'm quite familiar with them.

234
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,119
        And we are grateful
        for your contributions,

235
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,588
           which are necessary
           for the preservation
           of the realm.

236
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,790
 As is a royal wedding.

237
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,259
 The people are hungry
 for more than just food.

238
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,827
 They crave distractions.

239
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,047
 And if we don't provide them,
 they'll create their own.

240
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:22,549
 And their distractions
 are likely to

241
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:25,002
 end with us
 being torn to pieces.

242
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,789
 A royal wedding is much
 safer. Wouldn't you say?

243
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,524
                   I would.

244
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:35,930
 And traditionally paid for
 by the royal family.

245
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:40,368
 I was told you were drunk,
 impertinent,
 and thoroughly debauched.

246
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:42,603
 Imagine my disappointment
 at finding

247
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:44,805
 nothing but
 a browbeaten bookkeeper.

248
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,690
       (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

249
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,442
 Where did you go
 for them, Volantis?

250
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,196
                 My lady...
 Oh, very well.

251
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:56,000
 I won't have it said
 that House Tyrell refuses
 to play its part.

252
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:00,270
 We'll pay for half,
 and the celebrations
 will go on as planned.

253
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,289
 Is that sufficient?
              Quite. Thank you.

254
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,442
 Very good, then.
 That's settled. Good day.

255
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:09,597
                Give me that.
        (DOOR OPENING)

256
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,386
 ARYA: What are you doing?

257
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,172
            Just mending
            Lord Beric's armor.

258
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,658
        Why?

259
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,478
    I'm going to stay and smith
    for the Brotherhood.

260
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,564
 Have you lost your mind?

261
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,131
 When the Lannisters
 find this place,

262
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,800
 you think they'll
 spare the smiths?

263
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,369
 They'll cave your head in.

264
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,954
         They wanted to kill me
         long before I joined
         the Brotherhood.

265
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:36,140
 You don't have to.

266
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:39,293
            I want to.
            They need good men.

267
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:42,613
 Robb needs good men, too.
 We're leaving tomorrow.

268
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,781
 And then you...

269
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,882
               What? Serve him?

270
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:49,236
               I've served men
               my entire life.

271
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:53,574
       I served Master Mott
       at King's Landing, and
       he sold me to the Watch.

272
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:54,976
            I served Lord Tywin
            at Harrenhal,

273
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:59,513
            wondering every day
            if I'd get tortured

00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:07,133
              Pieces of you
              get chipped away.

408
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:10,921
          Could you bring back
          a man without a head?

409
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:17,695
      Not six times. Just once.

410
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,580
 I don't think
 it works that way, child.

411
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:32,108
  He was a good man, Ned Stark.
  He's at rest now, somewhere.

412
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:34,978
             I would never wish
             my life upon him.

413
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,513
                   I would.

00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,150
                You're alive.

 SELYSE: Lord,
 cast your light upon me.

416
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,079
 Protect me in the darkness.

417
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,216
 Burn away my sins.

418
00:28:57,385 --> 00:29:00,586
       Help me serve you.

423
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:27,981
     My lady.

424
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:29,883
 I meant to come sooner.

425
00:29:31,086 --> 00:29:32,586
      The battle...

426
00:29:32,654 --> 00:29:34,087
       I know of your troubles,
       my King.

427
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:36,756
        The Lady Melisandre
        has told me everything.

428
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,058
        Yes, of course.

       (SIGHS)

430
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:53,407
        You mustn't despair.
        Your claim is true.
        You will be victorious.

431
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:54,908
 I believed that once.

432
00:29:54,977 --> 00:30:00,463
        You are the One God's
        champion and the finest
        man I've ever known.

00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,615
         Selyse.

434
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:06,320
 I've broken a sacred vow.

435
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,758
 I've sinned.

436
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:13,226
                  No.

437
00:30:13,295 --> 00:30:15,012
 I've wronged you.

438
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,430
 I have shamed you.

439
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:18,265
       You're doing God's work.

440
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,732
 You don't understand.

441

    The Red Woman...

442
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:31,578
 The Lady Melisandre...

443
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:32,896
               I know, Stannis.

444
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,884
        The Lady Melisandre
        has told me everything.

445
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:42,289
         No act done in service
         of the Lord of Light
         can ever be a sin.

446
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:46,059
              When she told me,

447
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:51,214
               I wept with joy.

448
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:05,646
 Oh, my sweet boys.

449
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:12,602
 Petyr, Tommard, Edric.

450
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:20,544
        I thank God every day
        for bringing Melisandre
        to us.

451
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,862
            She gave you a son.

452
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,384
                     I gave you

453
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,336
                      nothing.
 That's not true.

454
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,161
            So, you've come
            to see her as well?

455
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,532
              There is no need.

456
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,620
        You must keep away
        from such distractions.

457
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:47,938
 She's my daughter.

 I want to see her.

 He did. He fought bravely.

00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:55,938
    He hasn't come to visit me.

475
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,708

             from the capital.

 You swore
 a solemn vow, remember?

 get me to King's Landing

 You protected me
 better than most...
             Don't you mock me.

00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,803

     I trust you.

00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,291
 There it is.
 There's the look.

512
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,728
 I've seen it for 17 years,
 on face after face.

513
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:51,931
 You all despise me.

514
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:55,785
    Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.

515
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,588
      A man without honor.

516
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,145
 You've heard of wildfire?

517
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:07,547
                   Of course.

518
00:36:07,616 --> 00:36:10,367
 The Mad King was
 obsessed with it.

519
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:13,486
 He loved to watch people burn,

520
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:18,224
 the way their skin
 blackened and blistered
 and melted off their bones.

521
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:20,393
 He burned lords
 he didn't like.

522
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:22,545
 He burned Hands
 who disobeyed him.

523
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,681
 He burned anyone
 who was against him.

524
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,686
 Before long, half
 the country was against him.

525
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,693
 Aerys saw traitors everywhere,

526
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:43,333
 so he had his pyromancer
 place caches of wildfire
 all over the city,

527
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:48,304
 beneath the Sept of Baelor
 and the slums of Flea Bottom.

528
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,958
     Under houses,
     stables, taverns.

529
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:54,260
   Even beneath
   the Red Keep itself.

530
00:36:56,865 --> 00:37:02,435
 Finally,
 the day of reckoning came.

531
00:37:02,504 --> 00:37:04,771
 Robert Baratheon
 marched on the capital

532
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,073
    after his victory
    at the Trident.

533
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:12,278
 But my father arrived first,
 with the whole
 Lannister army at his back,

534
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:16,149
 promising to defend the city
 against the rebels.

535
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:20,853
    I knew my father
    better than that.

536
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:23,123
 He's never been one to
 pick the losing side.

537
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,659
 I told the Mad King as much.

538
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:30,714
 I urged him to
 surrender peacefully.

539
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:33,950
 But the King
 didn't listen to me.

540
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,218
 He didn't listen to Varys,
 who tried to warn him.

541
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:40,924
 But he did listen to
 Grand Maester Pycelle,

542
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,092
 that gray, sunken cunt.

543
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,330
 "You can trust
 the Lannisters," he said.

544
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,703
 "The Lannisters
 have always been
 true friends of the crown."

545
00:37:56,074 --> 00:38:01,627
 So, we opened the gates,
 and my father sacked the city.

546
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:07,567
 Once again,
 I came to the King,
 begging him to surrender.

547
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:16,275
 He told me to bring him
 my father's head.

548
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,547
 Then he turned
 to his pyromancer.

549
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,519
 "Burn them all," he said.

550
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:31,507
 "Burn them in their homes.
 Burn them in their beds."

551
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:37,830
 Tell me,
 if your precious Renly

552
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,767
 commanded you to
 kill your own father

553
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:43,335
 and stand by
 while thousands of men,

554
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,838
 women, and children
 burned alive,

555
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,540
 would you have done it?

556
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:50,443
 Would you have
 kept your oath then?

557
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:58,251
 First,
 I killed the pyromancer.

558
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:02,922
 And then, when the King
 turned to flee,

559
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:06,359
 I drove my sword
 into his back.

560
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:11,130
 "Burn them all,"
 he kept saying.
 "Burn them all."

561
00:39:11,198 --> 00:39:13,332
 I don't think
 he expected to die.

562
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:20,706
 He meant to burn
 with the rest of us

563
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,208
 and rise again,

564
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,829
 reborn as a dragon to
 turn his enemies to ash.

565
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,320
 I slit his throat to
 make sure that didn't happen.

566
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,477
 That's where Ned Stark
 found me.

567
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:44,630
             If this is true...

568
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:45,931
          (GRUNTS SOFTLY)

569
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:47,784
    Why didn't you tell anyone?

570
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,788
               Why didn't you
               tell Lord Stark?

571
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,272
        Stark?

572
00:39:53,341 --> 00:40:00,046
 You think
 the honorable Ned Stark

573
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:03,332
 wanted to hear my side?

574
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:08,420
 He judged me guilty
 the moment he set eyes on me.

584
00:40:41,223 --> 00:40:43,706
 He's the fat one.
 He's on guard duty tonight.

585
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,175
 He likes to drink wine
 and sleep a lot.

586

          You're not
          supposed to be here.

 He said you were a traitor.

 Are you?

589
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:56,102
               I am, child.

590
00:40:56,171 --> 00:41:00,289
          I disobeyed my king,
          your father, and now
          I'm paying the price.

591

 I don't care.
 You're my friend.

592
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:06,412
 You must get bored
 down here. I brought you
 something to read.

593
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,764
 It's about Aegon
 and his dragons.

594
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,033
 Aegon used to live here.
 Did you know that?

595
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,968
 And the Targaryens
 built this castle.
                     Aye.

596
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,270
                   So they did.

597
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,772
 You can hide the book
 under your cloak.

598
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:17,891
 It's a good one.
 I'll bring you more.

599
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:20,793
     Thank you, my lady.
     I'm sure it's a fine book,

600
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:22,912
         but it's wasted on me.
      Take it.

00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,530
    I have more.

602

        I can't read the words.

00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,603
     You can't?

604

 I'll come when Bert's
 on duty and teach you.

                  Go. We can't.

     At the beginning.

610

 This word is "Aegon."

611
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:56,212
 When you see "A," "E,"
 and "G" together like that,

612
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,113
 it sounds like "egg."

 And the title
 of the whole book

614

 is An History of

 and His Conquest of Westeros.

           against King
           Robert's assassins

682
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,964
       while you were
       still bowing to the man.

683
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,735
 We both want her to rule.
 Am I wrong?

684
00:46:29,803 --> 00:46:31,654
             You only joined us
             a few days ago.

685
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,489
               I can't speak to
               your intentions.

686
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:36,008
 If we're truly
 her loyal servants,

687
00:46:36,077 --> 00:46:38,644
 we will do
 whatever needs to be done,

688
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,229
 no matter the cost,
 no matter our pride.

689
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:46,669
      You're not Lord Commander
      here. You're just
      another exile.

690
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,487
           And I take my orders
           from the Queen.

691
00:46:50,657 --> 00:46:52,457
       (NEIGHS)

692
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:58,264
 TALISA: Come to bed.

693
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,832
                You were right.

694
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:02,584
        The Karstarks are gone.

695
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,888
   (CLATTERING)
 Almost half our forces.

696
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:09,241
 Tywin Lannister
 knows what he needs to do
 to make us unravel.

697
00:47:10,211 --> 00:47:11,643
                  Nothing.

698
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:14,597
                  Only wait.

699
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,748
     Don't let him.

700
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:20,987
         What can I do?
         Attack King's Landing?

701
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:24,490
        There's nothing
        he'd like better.
        He'd crush us in a day.

702
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,593
 We could ride north.

703
00:47:27,662 --> 00:47:30,913
 Take your land back
 from the Greyjoys.
 Wait out the winter.

704
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:32,848
 Winter could
 last five years.

705
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:34,683
 Once my bannermen
 are home again,

706
00:47:34,752 --> 00:47:37,153
           sitting by the fire,
           surrounded by
           their families,

707
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:40,890
        warm and safe, they'll
        never ride south again.

708
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,260
       When I gathered my lords
       together, we had
       a purpose, a mission.

709
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:47,129
         Now we're like a band
         of bickering children.

710
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,466
 Give them a new purpose.

711
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,935
                  What?

712
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,308
 I don't know.
 I don't even know
 where Winterfell is.

713
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,046
                    Here.

714
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:09,468
                And we're here.

715
00:48:09,537 --> 00:48:10,602
              King's Landing...

716
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:19,078
           What is it?

717
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,851
 I can't force them to
 meet us in the field

718
00:48:25,919 --> 00:48:28,537
 and I can't attack them
 where they're strongest,

719
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:30,172
 but I can attack them
 where they're not.

720
00:48:32,226 --> 00:48:34,026
 And Casterly Rock
 can't run away.

721
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:39,482
 I'm going to take
 their home away from them.

722
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,752
                 Can you do it?

723
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,389
 I need men to
 replace the Karstarks
 who marched home.

724
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,357
         There is only one
         person in this kingdom

725
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:51,660
     with that kind of army
     who hasn't already
     sided with the Lannisters.

726
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:53,362
                     (LAUGHS)

727
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,648
       The man whose daughter
       I was supposed to marry.

728
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:58,584
               Walder Frey.

730
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:10,462
 He's such
 a splendid fighter.

731
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:14,316
 Do you have any idea
 when we might...

732
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:16,852
            I'll plant the seed
            as soon as Joffrey
            and I are married.

733
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:18,620
        It should grow quickly.

734
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:23,108
 Joffrey won't let me leave.
 He's got too many
 reasons to keep me here.

735
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:25,594
                 And only one
                 to let you go.

736
00:49:27,014 --> 00:49:28,931
     Because it will please me.

737
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,866
           LORAS: Squire.

738
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,755
              Well fought, ser.

739
00:49:35,823 --> 00:49:37,540
 That was no fight.

740
00:49:37,592 --> 00:49:38,757
 I don't know you.

741
00:49:38,826 --> 00:49:41,159
      Olyver, if it please you.

742
00:49:43,464 --> 00:49:46,465
         I should like to
         see you spar with
         a proper partner, ser.

745
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,590
 How did you know?

746
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,392
             Know what?

747
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,729
 That I wanted to.

748
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:02,564
             My lord...

749
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:08,337
 I'll have you know
 I'm to be married soon,

750
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:11,573
 and even my intended
 hasn't the slightest notion.

751
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:14,509
              They rarely do,
              in my experience.

752
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,179
 You have a good deal
 of experience, do you?

753
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:19,715
             With the husbands.

754
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,593
         That didn't take long.

755
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:33,562
 Well, it took long enough.

756
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:38,234
          It seems
          our Knight of Flowers
          is engaged to be wed.

757
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,002
    Is he?

758
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,404
       And...

759
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,472
 Who's the lucky girl?

760
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,609
 LITTLEFINGER: She may
 not be the grandest
 ship in the world

761
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:49,411
 or the fastest,

762
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,014
                but she's mine.

763
00:50:55,769 --> 00:51:00,022
     I've always wanted a ship.
     Now I want a dozen.

764
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:01,307
             Strange, isn't it?

765
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:02,558
      What is?

766
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:04,743
              It doesn't matter
              what we want,

767
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,796
                once we get it,
                then we want
                something else.

        Your hair is different.

769
00:51:14,021 --> 00:51:15,821
     Is it?

770
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:17,273
             Lady Margaery
             wears it that way.

771
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:20,076
 Many ladies
 wear it this way.

772
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:23,662
              I have good news.
              I'll be leaving
              the city soon.

773
00:51:23,731 --> 00:51:25,180
 You still want me
 to come with you?

774
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:29,334
     It's not
     a question of what I want.
     It's what you want.

775
00:51:29,403 --> 00:51:31,069
           You want to go home,
           don't you?

776
00:51:31,138 --> 00:51:33,104
 Of course.
 More than anything.

777
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:39,628
 But maybe it would
 be better to wait.

778
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:44,817
 I've been thinking how
 dangerous it would be.
 Not just for me, but for you.

779
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:49,889
 You've been so kind.
 I'd feel terrible if
 anything happened to you.

780
00:51:49,957 --> 00:51:51,924
               I can't tell you
               how touched I am

781
00:51:51,993 --> 00:51:53,925
                by your concern
                for my welfare.

782
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:58,347
        I hope you know that
        I'm your friend, Sansa.

783
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,950
              Your true friend.

 I do, Lord Baelish.

787
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,941
           If you wish to stay,
           then of course
           you will stay.

788
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:17,466
              We'll speak again
              when I return.

00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,500
         What's she doing here?

00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,402
             Our business
             concerns her, too.

00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:39,120
                         Sit.

794
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,642
              You'll be pleased
              to learn that

795
00:52:43,711 --> 00:52:46,511
         after one conversation
         with Olenna Tyrell,

796
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:50,849
          I've saved the crown
          hundreds of thousands
          on this wedding.

797
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,551
 Never mind that now.
 We have something
 important to discuss.

798
00:52:53,621 --> 00:52:57,022
     I'm Master of Coin.
     Saving money is important.

799
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,275
       Stop that. You're
       making me uncomfortable.

800
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:03,328
 Your sister has learned
 that your new friends
 the Tyrells

801
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:06,749
 are plotting to marry
 Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

802
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:10,318
           Very well.
           She's a lovely girl.

803
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:14,005
    Missing some of Loras'
    favorite bits, but I'm sure
    they'll make do.

804
00:53:14,074 --> 00:53:15,406
   Your jokes are
   not appreciated.

805
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:17,075
      It wasn't
      my best, but...

806
00:53:17,144 --> 00:53:19,895
 I bring them into
 the royal fold, and
 this is how they repay me,

807
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,232
 by trying to steal
 the key to the North
 out from under me.

808
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:27,352
      Sansa is the key to the
      North? I seem to remember
      she has an older brother.

809
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:29,304
 The Karstarks
 have marched home.

 murdered both his brothers.

812
00:53:35,496 --> 00:53:39,414
 That makes Sansa Stark
 the heir to Winterfell,

813
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:42,734
 and I am not about
 to hand her over
 to the Tyrells.

814
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:45,621
    TYRION: The Tyrell army is
    helping us to win this war.

815
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,806
      Do you really think
      it's wise to refuse them?

816
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:50,225
 There's nothing to refuse.
 This is a plot.

817
00:53:50,294 --> 00:53:52,544
 Plots are not
 public knowledge.

818
00:53:52,613 --> 00:53:56,548
 And the Tyrells won't
 carry this one out until
 after Joffrey's wedding.

819
00:53:56,616 --> 00:54:00,468
 We need to act first
 and kill this union
 in its crib.

820
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:01,803
         And how do we do that?

821
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:04,038
 We find Sansa Stark
 a different husband.

822
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:05,323
                  Wonderful.

823
00:54:05,392 --> 00:54:06,609
 Yes, it is.

824
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:15,968
             You can't mean it.

825
00:54:16,036 --> 00:54:17,719
 I can and I do.

826
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:20,138
               Joffrey's made
               this poor girl's
               life miserable

827
00:54:20,207 --> 00:54:22,941
          since the day he took
          her father's head.

828
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,611
            Now she's finally
            free of him, and
            you give her to me?

829
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,112
                  That's cruel,
                  even for you.

830
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,314
 Do you intend on
 mistreating her?

831
00:54:29,383 --> 00:54:32,234
 The girl's happiness
 is not my concern,
 nor yours.

832
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,952
                 She's a child!

833
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,405
 She's flowered, I assure
 you. She and I have
 discussed it at length.

834
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,073
 There, you see?
 You will wed her,

835
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:40,208
 bed her,
 and put a child in her.

836
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:41,577
 Surely you're
 capable of that.

837
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:42,928
               And if I refuse?

838
00:54:42,997 --> 00:54:45,914
 You wanted to be rewarded
 for your valor in battle.

839
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:50,035
 Sansa Stark is a finer
 reward than you could
 ever dare hope for.

840
00:54:50,104 --> 00:54:52,237
 And it is past time
 you were wed.

841
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:53,822
                   I was wed.

842
00:54:55,242 --> 00:54:56,875
         Or don't you remember?

843
00:54:59,413 --> 00:55:01,980
    Only too well.

844
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:06,885
 You should be thanking
 the Gods for this. This is
 more than you deserve.

845
00:55:06,954 --> 00:55:11,356
 Tyrion will do as he's bid.
 As will you.

846
00:55:11,425 --> 00:55:12,657
 (TYWIN CLEARS THROAT)

847
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,392
              What do you mean?

848
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:16,261
 You'll marry Ser Loras.

849
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:19,982
                    I will not.

850
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,366
 The boy is heir
 to Highgarden.

851
00:55:21,435 --> 00:55:23,602
 Tyrion will secure the North,
 you will secure the Reach.

852
00:55:23,688 --> 00:55:25,170
             No, I won't do it.

853
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,704
      Yes, you will.

854
00:55:26,773 --> 00:55:29,090
 You're still fertile.
 You need to marry
 again and breed.

855
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,192
            I am Queen Regent,
            not some broodmare.

856
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:34,029
 You're my daughter!

857
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:38,299
 You will do as I command,
 and you will
 marry Loras Tyrell

858
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:43,188
 and put an end to
 the disgusting rumors
 about you once and for all.

859
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,839
          Father, don't make me
          do it again, please.

860
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,408
              Not another word.

861
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:49,094
    My children.

862
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,632
 You've disgraced
 the Lannister name
 for far too long.
