 on the other hand...

           Lord Desmond's bed.

49
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,116
          You cut a little hole
          in his mattress

50
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,100
             and you stuff
             sheep dung inside.

51
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:49,253
       Then you sew up the hole
       and make his bed again.

52
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:52,040
        His room will stink,
        but he won't know

              Show him.

     Write back to Lord Frey.

00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:17,159
  Thank him for his

00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,334
 A joke.
 Joffrey did not mean it.

80
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:28,269
        Yes, I did.

81
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:31,006
           I'm going to have it
           served to Sansa

              She is no longer
              yours to torment.

84
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,296
 Everyone is mine to torment.

85
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,117
            You'd do well
            to remember that,
            you little monster.

86
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:45,070
             Oh, I'm a monster.

87
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,573
       Perhaps you should speak
       to me more softly, then.

88
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:55,413
        Monsters are dangerous,
        and just now kings
        are dying like flies.

89
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:06,608
 I could have your
 tongue out for saying that.

 He's a bitter little man.

93
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:15,232
         Lord Tyrion should
         apologize immediately.

94
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:20,321
   Unacceptable, disrespectful,
   and in very bad taste.

      I am the King!

96
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,776
       I will punish you.

97
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:29,080
 Any man who must say,
 "I am the King,"
 is no true king.

98
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,866
 I'll make sure
 you understand that

99
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:33,618
 when I've won
 your war for you.

100
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:37,989
    My father won the real war.
    He killed Prince Rhaegar.

101
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,993
           He took the crown
           while you hid
           under Casterly Rock!

102
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:59,043
 The King is tired.
 See him to his chambers.

103
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,978
          Come along.
                 I'm not tired.

104
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,965
        We have so much
        to celebrate.

 Grand Maester,
 perhaps some
 essence of nightshade

107
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,359
 to help him sleep.

108
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,711
    I'm not tired!

109

                  CERSEI: Come.

           (DOOR OPENING)

111
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,887
     Not you.

112
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,764
          You just sent
          the most powerful man

113
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,600
            in Westeros to bed
            without his supper.

114
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:59,070
 You're a fool if you
 believe he's the most
 powerful man in Westeros.

115
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,157
        A treasonous statement.
        Joffrey is King.

116
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,876
 You really think
 a crown gives you power?

117
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,013
                            No.

118
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,848
                I think armies
                give you power.

119
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,500
 Mmm-hmm.

120
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:16,237
           Robb Stark had one,
           never lost a battle,

121
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,706
           and you defeated him
           all the same.

122
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:19,891
         Mmm-hmm.

123
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,909
                    Oh, I know.

124
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,812
               Walder Frey gets
               all the credit.

125
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:30,051
       Or the blame, I suppose,
       depending on
       your allegiance.

126
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,154
               Walder Frey
               is many things,
               but a brave man?

127
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,223
                   No.

128
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:38,893
          He never would have
          risked such an action

129
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:41,296
            if he didn't have
            certain assurances.

130
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:43,497
 Which he got from me.

131
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,134
 Do you disapprove?

132
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:48,086
          I'm all for cheating.
          This is war.

133
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,321
          But to slaughter them
          at a wedding...

134
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,140
 Explain to me
 why it is more noble

135
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,444
 to kill 10,000 men in battle
 than a dozen at dinner.

136
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,214
      So that's why you did it?
      To save lives?

137
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:03,435
 To end the war.
 To protect the family.

138
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,688
 Do you want to write a song
 for the dead Starks?

139
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:09,190
 Go ahead, write one.

140
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:12,611
 I'm in this world
 a little while longer

141
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,398
 to defend the Lannisters,
 to defend my blood.

142
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,933
            The Northerners
            will never forget.

143
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,551
            Good.

144
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,338
 Let them remember
 what happens when
 they march on the South.

145
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:28,259
 All the Stark men are dead.

146
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,196
 Winterfell is a ruin.

147
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:36,850
 Roose Bolton will be named
 Warden of the North

148
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,888
 until your son by Sansa
 comes of age.

149
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:48,930
 I believe you
 still have some work
 to do on that score.

150
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:52,099
           Do you think she'll
           open her legs for me

151
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:55,637
            after I tell her
            how we murdered her
            mother and brother?

152
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:58,872
 One way or another,
 you will get
 that girl pregnant.

153
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,208
           I will not rape her.

154
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,980
 Shall I explain to you
 in one easy lesson
 how the world works?

155
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:08,966
      Use small words.
      I'm not as bright as you.

156
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,136
 The house that
 puts family first
 will always defeat

157
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,405
 the house that puts
 the whims and wishes

158
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,591
 of its sons and
 daughters first.

159
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,211
 A good man does
 everything in his power

160
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,381
 to better
 his family's position,

161
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,818
 regardless of
 his own selfish desires.

162
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,507
 Does that amuse you?

163
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,992
   No, it's a very good lesson.

164
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:38,196
         Only it's easy for you
         to preach utter
         devotion to family

165
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,965
             when you're making
             all the decisions.

166
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:42,984
 Easy for me, is it?

167
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:46,320
       When have you ever
       done something that
       wasn't in your interest,

168
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:48,589
     but solely for
     the benefit of the family?

169
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:51,225
 The day that you were born.

170
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:57,899
 I wanted to carry you
 into the sea

171
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,900
 and let the waves
 wash you away.

172
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:04,622
 Instead, I let you live.

173
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,276
 And I brought
 you up as my son.

174
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,065
 Because you're a Lannister.

182
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:20,581
               Don't, Hodor.

183
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,521

        we shouldn't stay here.

184
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,425
 You'd rather be out there?

185
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:33,394
      There are a lot of
      stories about this place.

186
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,913
              Horrible stories.

187
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:38,249
 I always quite liked
 the horrible stories.

188
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,768
                So did I. Once.

189
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,340
            You ever heard
            about the Rat Cook?

190
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,659
            No. Who's he?

191
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:51,713
             Just a cook in
             the Night's Watch.

192
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:56,351
        He was angry at
        the King for something,
        I don't remember.

193
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,153
        When the King was
        visiting the Nightfort,

194
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:01,522
                the cook killed
                the King's son,

195
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:07,295
      cooked him into a big pie
      with onions, carrots,
      mushrooms, and bacon.

196
00:14:07,364 --> 00:14:11,165
           That night he served
           the pie to the King.

197
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:16,070
   He liked the taste
   of his son so much,
   he asked for a second slice.

198
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:21,959
       The Gods turned the cook
       into a giant white rat

199
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,294
             who could only
             eat his own young.

200
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:30,617
      He's been roaming
      the Nightfort ever since,
      devouring his own babies.

201
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:36,658
   But no matter what he does,
   he's always hungry.

202
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:39,877
 If the Gods
 turned every killer
 into a giant white rat...

203
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,380
   It wasn't for murder
   the Gods cursed the Rat Cook

204
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,216
       or for serving
       the King's son in a pie.

205
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,552
             He killed a guest
             beneath his roof.

206

        That's something

00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:05,448
          There are more.

405
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,384
 Many more.

406
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,755
 And for every one of them,

407
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,456
          the dead men,

408
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,093
   more than you could count.

409
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,899
   I wish you'd come with us.

410
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,702
               I wish I could.

411
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,038
                I really do.

412
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,187
 How are you keeping?

413
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,891
           Great. Never better.

414
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,094
 It was just a bit of blood.

415
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,030
         I should have known.

416
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,834
       Every time
       a highborn asks my name,
       it's trouble.

417
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,669
        We're not
        really people to you.

418
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,420
           Just ways to
           get what you want.

419
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:35,755
 I'm not a highborn.

420
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:37,023
    She called you "Ser."

421
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:38,458
         I heard it.

422
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,396
 A recent state of affairs.

423
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:50,703
 I was born in Flea Bottom,
 just like you.

424
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:54,507
           Sure, you were.
           You're my friend.
           You're here to help.

425
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:56,509
 I lived below
 the Street of Flour.

426
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:00,013
      How far below?
      How close to
      the Red Keep were you?

427
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:04,150
 The shit that poured
 from their privy pipes

428
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,921
 flowed down
 the side of Aegon's Hill,

429
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:11,875
 along Tanner's Row
 and right in front
 of my front door

430
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:13,927
     on Gin Alley.
                  Gin Alley.

431
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:20,767
 The Street of Steel,
 with your armor
 and your knights?

432
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:22,068
      (SCOFFS)

433
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:24,471
 You lived in
 the fancy part of town.

434
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,327
 And here we are now.

435
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:35,365
 Two boys from Flea Bottom
 in the castle of a king.

436
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,501
               Yeah, we've
               come a long way.

437
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,670
            We're all the same,
            really.

438
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,757
       She went to great pains
       to point that out to me.

439
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:46,460
 If you mistrust
 fancy people so much,

440
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,129
 why were you in such
 a hurry to trust her?

441
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,032
      You're me.

442
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:54,501
 Never been with a woman.

443
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,320
       Never talked to a woman,
       really.

444
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,839
     And then she comes at you,

445
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,058
         big words, no clothes.

446
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:05,528
      What would you have done?

447
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:09,766
 She does know her way
 around a man's head,
 I'll give her that.

448
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,401
        (BOTH CHUCKLING)

449
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,390
                 So how'd you
                 become a lord?

450
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,259
 Oh. That's a long story.

451
00:31:19,328 --> 00:31:22,162
              Better not, then.
              I'm a bit busy.

452
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,952
 Many years ago
 I helped King Stannis
 out of a difficult situation.

453
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:31,805
 He rewarded me
 with a lordship.

454
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:34,941
      And this.

455
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:38,962
                You see?

456
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,431
               Highborns.

457
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:49,873
 I didn't want to be a lord.
 I nearly didn't accept.

458
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,358
                Why did you?

459
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:53,226
 I did it for my son.

460
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,996
 I didn't want him to
 step over a river of shit

461
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:59,499
 every time he stepped
 through his front door.

462
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,570
 I wanted him to
 have a better life.

463
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:06,506
           Does he?

464
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:09,376
                He's dead.

465
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:16,466
              How'd he die?

466
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,020
            Following me.

467
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,767
          When did you come to
          this strange country?

468
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:37,603
                 When I was 13.

469
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:39,356
         You were only a child.

470
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:43,677
 I stopped being
 a child when I was nine.

471
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:45,812
 My mother made sure of that.

472
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:51,651
        You've been a good
        influence on our mutual
        friend, you know.

473
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,388
  He used to drink
  from sundown to sunup,
  visit three brothels a night,

474
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:57,957
            gamble away
            his father's money.

475
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:59,859
    Now it's just the drinking.

476
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,346
 And now
 I'm his wife's servant.

477
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:06,816
 I brush her hair
 and clip her nails
 and empty her chamber pot.

478
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:09,819
    She is a sweet young thing.
    None of this is her fault.

479
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,322
 I love that girl.
 I would kill for her.

480
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,775
 Do you think that
 makes it easier for me?

481
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,127
              No, I expect not.

482
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:23,716
 She's young
 and she's beautiful
 and highborn.

483
00:33:23,786 --> 00:33:28,088
      We break bread with them,
      but that doesn't
      make us family.

484
00:33:28,157 --> 00:33:32,259
     We've learned their
     language, but we'll
     never be their countrymen.

485
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,879
    If you let yourself believe

486
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,115
            that a foreign girl
            with no name

487
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,551
  could spend her life with
  the son of Tywin Lannister...

488
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,985
 I have a name.

489
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:44,454
             You have one name.

490
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:48,892
       As do I. Here, only
       the family name matters.

491
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,027
 What do you want
 from me, Lord Varys?

492
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,566
                    Diamonds.

493
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,502
       I'd tell you to beware
       carrying so much wealth,

494
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:02,838
           but you know how
           to protect yourself.

495
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:07,961
          Get on one of those
          ships. Sail to Pentos
          or Lys or Myr.

496
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:12,632
           You can buy a house
           with these diamonds,
           a very large house.

497
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:14,500
                 Hire servants.

498
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:18,938
    Start a new life,
    a good life, far from here.

499
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:23,993
        The mysterious foreign
        beauty. You'll
        have suitors lining up.

500
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,845
 Why do you want me to leave?

501
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:28,298
        Tyrion Lannister is one
        of the few people alive

502
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,667
        who could make this
        country a better place.

503
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,820
     He has the mind, the will,
     and the right last name.

504
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:35,188
                       And you,

505
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:39,058
        you are a complication.

506
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:42,962
           I know you love him.

507
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:46,566
          And I know it's
          true love, not bought
          by gold and silver.

508
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:49,051
          I'm not asking you to
          leave him for money.

509
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:51,754
        I'm asking you to leave

510
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:56,910
          because your presence
          in the capital
          endangers him.

511
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:00,797
            This will never be
            your home, my lady.

512
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,617
       Find a true home
       somewhere far from here,

513
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,087
      while there's still time.

514
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,440
    Lord Varys.

515
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:18,831
 If he wants me to leave,
 he can tell me himself.

516
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:29,792
         Keep up.

517
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,045
           I don't think I can,
           my lord.

518
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,683
 It's not easy being
 drunk all the time.

      (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

522
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,958
            Leave.

524

     So, enjoying married life?

           (DOOR CLOSES)

526
00:36:00,942 --> 00:36:04,611
 An unhappy wife
 is a wine merchant's
 best friend.

527
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,781
      She doesn't deserve this.

528
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:09,348
 Deserve?

529
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,284
     Be careful with that.

530
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,387
    Start trying to work
    out who deserves what,

531
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:18,391
         and before long
         you'll spend your days

532
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,378
           weeping for every
           person in the world.

533
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:24,798
 There's nothing worse
 than a late-blooming
 philosopher.

                     (CHUCKLES)

535
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:28,734
 Will you be facing
 your marriage to Ser Loras

536
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:31,504
 with the same
 philosophical spirit?

537
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:33,172
            I won't be
            marrying Ser Loras.

538
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:38,027
 I seem to remember
 saying something similar
 about my own marriage.

       Give her a child.

541

 So you can tell
 Father it was you who
 finally talked me into it?

542

         So she can have some
         happiness in her life.

        from the highest

 Before Myrcella was born.

 hands and feet.

 He was such
 a jolly little fellow.

 with me, he was happy.

   What he saw beyond the Wall,
   it's coming for all of us.

                 When did you
                 learn to read?

            before he died,

813
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:33,294
         so I could be of
         better service to you.

      This War of Five Kings
      means nothing.

815
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:47,092
 The true war lies to
 the north, my King.

 Only you can stop him.

 You can't stop him alone.

819
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,687
 You need someone to
 rebuild your army for you,

820
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:01,089
 someone to convince
 this lord and that lord
 to fight for you,

821
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:03,492
 to bring sellswords
 and pirates to your side.

822
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:07,145
 I've made my decision.

823
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:13,185
      He's right. You need him.
      He has a part to play
      in the war to come.

 You're in His army now.

 When they're ready.

830
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,168
          Perhaps they didn't
          want to be conquered.

831
00:57:03,237 --> 00:57:08,340
       You didn't conquer them.
       You liberated them.

 It is old Ghiscari,
