              before we leave,

    than a fortnight thereafter

 It will put his heart at
 peace if he could see her
 wed to a good husband.

00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:21,141
      And his recent experience
      has made him wary

 I didn't wound him.

        very carefully. You...

 The laws of gods and
 men are very clear.

397
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,974
 No man can compel
 another man to marry.

398
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,309
            The laws of my fist
            are about to
            compel your teeth.

 It's all right.
 You heard him.

 our alliance with
 the Freys is dead.

           stop wanting it now.

403
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,559
 When I say no,
 he will come back

 and offer me
 a daughter of my choosing.

              You're willing to
              risk our freedom

406
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,130
            and our lives
            for a chance
            at a prettier wife?

407
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,550
 I have a war to fight.

408
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,421
 We can't win it without them.
 I have no time to haggle.

409
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,291
 You said you wanted
 to make amends for
 the Stone Mill.

410
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:47,226
             You recall that
             heroic engagement?

411
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:54,885
       I had something
       less permanent in mind.

412
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:58,454
 I've won every battle,
 but I'm losing this war.

413
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:05,595
 If we don't do this and
 do it now, we're lost.

414
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,487
 I'll marry her.

415
00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:17,991
 You're paying
 for my sins, Uncle.
 It's not fair or right.

416
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:20,410
 I'll remember it.

417
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:30,570
    BOLTON: I see my men have
    finally found you something
    appropriate to wear.

418
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,672
 BRIENNE: Yes.
 Most kind of them.

419
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,443
 You're a Stark bannerman,
 Lord Bolton.

420
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:38,929
            I am acting on
            Lady Stark's orders

421
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,330
      to return Jaime Lannister
      to King's Landing.

422
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,035
          When King Robb left
          Harrenhal, his mother
          was his prisoner.

423
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:48,488
      If she wasn't his mother,
      he'd have hanged
      her for treason.

424
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,482
            I should send you
            back to Robb Stark.

425
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,417
 You should.

426
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:04,688
 But instead,
 you're sitting here,
 watching me fail at dinner.

427
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,658
 Why might that be?

428
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,778
          Wars cost money.
          Many people would pay
          a great deal for you.

429
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,147
 We both know who
 would pay the most.

430
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:19,019
 Or make you pay the most
 if he found out
 you had captured me

431
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:21,521
 and sent me back up north
 for a summary execution.

432
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,090
                 You're right.

433
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:27,911
      Perhaps the safest thing
      to do is to kill you both
      and burn your bodies.

434
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,712
 JAIME: It would be,

435
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,832
 if you honestly believed
 my father would
 never find out about it.

436
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:35,201
        King Robb is keeping
        your father quite busy.

437
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,904
           He doesn't have time
           for anything else.

438
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:39,406
 He'll make time for you.

439
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:45,679
         As soon as you're
         well enough to travel,

440
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:47,814
           I will allow you to
           go to King's Landing

441
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,768
   as restitution
   for the mistakes
   my soldiers made.

442
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:54,771
 And you will swear to
 tell your father the truth,

443
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,341
 that I had nothing to
 do with your maiming.

444
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,582
 Shall we drink on it?

445
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:06,849
               I don't partake.

446
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,389
 You do understand
 how suspicious that is
 to ordinary people?

447
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,059
 Very well.

448
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:21,464
 My lady,
 may our journey continue
 without further incident.

449
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,333
               Oh, she won't be
               going with you.

450
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,702
 I am charged with
 bringing Ser Jaime to...

451
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:28,471
        BOLTON: You are charged
        with abetting treason.

452
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,740
 I'm afraid I must insist.

453
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,760
         You're in no place
         to insist on anything.

454
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:36,429
      I would have hoped
      you'd learned your lesson

455
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:39,082
              about overplaying
              your position.

456
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,321
 OLENNA: Impossible.
         Why?

457
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,840
 My grandson is
 the pride of Highgarden.

458
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:51,594
 The most desirable bachelor
 in all seven kingdoms.

459
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,580
   Your daughter...
         Is rich,

460
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:57,017
 the most beautiful woman
 in all seven kingdoms,

461
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,470
 and the mother of the King.

462
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,554
         Old.

463
00:34:02,658 --> 00:34:03,657
      Old?

464
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,776
           Old.

465
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,312
 I'm something of
 an expert on the subject.

466
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,798
 Her change will be
 upon her before long.

467
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:15,434
 I'll spare you the details
 of what will happen then.

468
00:34:15,503 --> 00:34:18,121
 You may have a stomach
 for bloodshed and slaughter,

469
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,723
 but this is
 another matter entirely.

470
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:24,093
   The years punish us as well,
   I promise you that.

471
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:31,067
         My stomach remains
         quite strong, however.

472
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:33,736
      The only thing that
      might turn it are details

473
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,339
          of your grandson's
          nocturnal activities.

474
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:38,592
              Do you deny them?

475
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,693
   Oh, not at all.

476
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:41,828
 A sword-swallower
 through and through.

477
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:45,315
      A boy with his affliction
      should be grateful
      for the opportunity

478
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:48,384
       to marry
       the most beautiful woman
       in the Kingdoms

479
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:51,020
       and remove
       the stain from his name.

480
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,723
     Did you grow up
     with boy cousins,
     Lord Tywin?

481
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:57,894
   Sons of your
   father's bannermen,
   squires, stable boys?

482
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:59,779
               Of course.

483
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,999
     And you never...

484
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,051
                  No.

485
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:08,805
 Not once? Not in any way?

486
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,490
                 Never.

487
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,676
 I congratulate you
 upon your restraint.

488
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:17,447
 But it's natural,
 boys having a go
 beneath the sheets.

489
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:22,352
        Perhaps Highgarden
        has a high tolerance
        for unnatural behavior.

490
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:23,920
 I wouldn't say that.

491
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:26,489
 True, we don't tie
 ourselves in knots

492
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,991
 over a discreet
 bit of buggery, but

493
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,447
 brothers and sisters...

494
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:39,352
 Where I come from,
 that stain would be very
 difficult to wash out.

495
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,688
           I will not
           breathe further life

496
00:35:41,757 --> 00:35:43,974
           into a malicious lie
           by discussing it.

497
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,677
             Lie or not,

498
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:51,014
     you must admit many people
     find it quite convincing.

499
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,432
        Convincing enough
        to put swords
        in their hands

500
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:56,736
 and send them off
 to kill Lannisters
 and Tyrells,

501
00:35:56,805 --> 00:35:58,738
 thanks to our new affiliation.

502
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:00,690
 I don't care
 what people believe.

503
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,625
            And neither do you.

           (CHUCKLES)

505
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:08,130
    As an authority on myself,
    I must disagree.

506
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,567
       Now, if the rumors about
       my children were true,

507
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,320
                then Joffrey is
                no king at all,

508
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:18,675
         and House Tyrell
         is throwing its prized
         flower into the dirt.

509
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:22,262
 And if Cersei is too old
 to give Loras children,

510
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:26,666
 we're throwing another
 prized flower into the dirt.

511
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:30,186
   It is a chance
   we simply cannot take.

512
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:32,438
       The uncertainty
       makes you uncomfortable?

513
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:34,640
                     All right.

514
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,343
    I'll remove it for you.

515
00:36:38,513 --> 00:36:41,397
         If you refuse to
         marry Loras to Cersei,

516
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:44,918
             I will name him
             to the Kingsguard.

517
00:36:44,986 --> 00:36:48,054
      I'm sure you're familiar
      with the Kingsguard vows.

518
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,490
   He will never marry.
   He will never have children.

519
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:52,308
            Ah.

520
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,177
     The Tyrell name will fade.

521
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:57,980
          And Highgarden will
          go to the children of
          Joffrey and Margaery.

522
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:02,118
 You would have your
 grandson protected by
 someone who disgusts you?

523
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,905
       I would have my grandson
       protected by
       a skilled warrior

524
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:09,158
           who takes
           his vows seriously.

525
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,694
            So, shall I draw up
            the order?

526
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:15,632
         Or do you
         consent to this match?

527
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:26,525
 It's a rare enough thing,
 a man who lives up
 to his reputation.

 SANSA: That's a wonderful pin.

554
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,275
 It's more of
 a brooch, really.

555
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,531
 Though I suppose a brooch
 is a sort of pin, so...

556
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,973
        I'm very happy about...

557
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,578
 Yes. I am as well.

 I'm in a dream. (CHUCKLES)

559

                  Yes, me, too.
                  Definitely.

560
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:43,506
             I've dreamed of
             a large wedding
             since I was young.

561
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:46,842
 The guests, the food,
 the tournaments.

562
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,498
 And the bride, of course.

563
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,383
 (CHUCKLES)

564
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,806
 The most beautiful
 bride in the world

565
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,743
 in a beautiful gown of
 gold and green brocade
 with fringed sleeves.

566
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:08,498
 Have you ever been to
 Highgarden, my lady?

567
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,501
                No. I had never
                left Winterfell

568
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,504
               before I came to
               King's Landing.

569
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,640
       But it sounds wonderful.
       I can't wait to see it.

570
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,677
       And to leave this place.

571
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,646
 It's terrible, isn't it?

572
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,601
 The most
 terrible place there is.

573
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,464
 TYRION: I don't suppose
 there's anything
 we can do about this.

574
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,332
              We can have
              them both killed.

575
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:47,570
 It's hard to say
 which of the four of us

576
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,472
 is getting the worst
 of this arrangement.

577
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,475
 Probably Sansa.

578
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:57,313
 Though Loras will
 certainly come to know
 a deep and singular misery.

579
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:59,982
               Father doesn't
               discriminate.

580
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,152
                We're all being
                shipped off to
                hell together.

581
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,788
           On a boat you built.

582
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,991
 The Tyrells were plotting
 to undermine our family.

583
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,543
 I did what I did to
 protect our family.

584
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,011
               I'm your family.

585
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:16,165
        A member of your
        family who has actively

586
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:20,419
            contributed to that
            family's survival.

587
00:42:20,488 --> 00:42:23,573
       Whether or not you
       or Father or anyone else
       wants to admit it.

588
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,974
      I do admit it.

589
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,811
 If it weren't for your
 trick with the wildfire,

590
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,832
 Stannis would
 have sacked the city
 before Father got here.

591
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,201
 Our heads would still be
 rotting on the city gate.

592
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:39,339
       Trying to have me killed
       is an odd way of
       saying thank you.

593
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,876
           There are two people
           in King's Landing

594
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:45,978
      who can give
      an order to a Kingsguard.

595
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:48,865
           Did you or did you
           not order Ser Mandon

596
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:51,684
              to kill me during
              the Battle of
              the Blackwater?

597
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:03,663
      The impulse I understand.

598
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,000
       He hates me
       because I'm the only one

599
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:10,703
             who tells him
             what he really is.

600
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:20,913
             So, fair enough.
             He wants me dead.
             But his stupidity?

601
00:43:20,982 --> 00:43:24,350
 He could have had me
 poisoned and no one
 would have known.

602
00:43:24,419 --> 00:43:27,854
 But the King
 orders a Kingsguard

603
00:43:27,922 --> 00:43:31,758
 to murder the Hand
 of the King in full view
 of his own army.

604
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:33,359
 The boy's an idiot.

605
00:43:33,428 --> 00:43:34,894
                What do you
                want me to say?

606
00:43:34,962 --> 00:43:37,764
 I want you to tell me
 if my life is
 still in danger.

607
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:40,333
                     Probably.

608
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:43,469
 But not from Joffrey.
 He won't do anything
 now Father's here.

609
00:43:45,273 --> 00:43:49,442
 Seven kingdoms united in fear
 of Tywin Lannister.

610
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:52,445
               Not the Tyrells.

611
00:43:52,513 --> 00:43:54,613
 Soon they won't need
 to be afraid of him.

612
00:43:54,682 --> 00:43:58,150
 Joffrey will
 belong to Margaery,
 the little doe-eyed whore,

613
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:01,019
 and so will his
 children and their children.

614
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:03,089
 History will be
 taken from our hands.

615
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,309
      You may escape, at least.

616
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,013
          Once Jaime gets back,

617
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:13,716
      Ser Loras may come
      down with a terrible case
      of sword through bowels.

618
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,453
 When Jaime gets back, yes.

619
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:20,573
 But when will that be?
 He's out there somewhere.

620
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:26,461
 Jaime or not,
 I'm truly fucked.

621
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:31,667
       Who's going to tell her?

622
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,321
           Do you think
           people will like it?

623
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:37,840
 SHAE: I don't think
 they will even notice it.

624
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,242
        You're right.
        It's not my wedding.

625
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,379
         Anyway, from
         what I can tell,

626
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:45,381
         the dressmakers in
         Highgarden will be

627
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,549
    far superior to
    the ones in King's Landing.

628
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,520
       They'd never make me
       anything as dull as this
       for my wedding.

629
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,590
         Loras likes green
         and gold brocade.

630
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,458
 I'm sure he does.

631
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,146
           Will they let me
           invite my family?

632
00:45:00,214 --> 00:45:02,281
             They haven't asked
             my opinion.

633
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,183
 But do you think they will?

634
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:06,385
                      No.

635
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:14,544
 Lady Sansa,
 Lord Tyrion to see you.

636
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:15,711
 Should I...

637
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,915
  I beg your pardon,
  my lady.

638
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:22,134
   Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.
   I was trying on a gown
   for Joffrey's wedding.

639
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,739
     Yes, it should be
     quite a wedding.

640
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:31,477
 I need to speak
 with you, Lady Sansa.

641
00:45:31,546 --> 00:45:32,645
             Of course.

642
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:35,280
     Alone, if I may.

643
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,149
 Why do you need to
 speak to her alone?

644
00:45:37,218 --> 00:45:38,951
              Shae.

645
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:41,887
        Please excuse her.
        She's not from here.

646
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:45,658
           But I trust her,
           even though she
           tells me not to.

647
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:51,781
 Sometimes we think
 we want to hear something,

648
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,333
 and it's only afterwards,
 when it's too late,

649
00:45:54,402 --> 00:45:56,685
 that we realize
 we wished we'd heard it

650
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,505
 under entirely
 different circumstances.

651
00:45:59,573 --> 00:46:00,873
        It's all right, really.

652
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:07,213
 How to begin?

653
00:46:08,816 --> 00:46:09,849
 (DOOR CLOSES)

654
00:46:09,918 --> 00:46:11,300
 TYRION: It's... This...

655
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,054
 This... This is awkward.

 forged in the fiery breath
 of Balerion the Dread.

659
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,217
                  There aren't
                  1,000 blades.

660
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:32,221
         There aren't even 200.

661
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,956
                  I've counted.

662
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:35,624
 VARYS: (SCOFFS)
 I'm sure you have.

663
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,144
         Ugly old thing.

664
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,147
   LITTLEFINGER:
   Yet it has a certain appeal.

665
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,333
         The Lysa Arryn
         of chairs.

666
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:47,352
      Shame you had to settle
      for your second choice.

667
00:46:47,422 --> 00:46:49,505
 Early days, my friend.

668
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,990
              It is flattering,
              really,

669
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:58,997
 you feeling such dread
 at the prospect of me
 getting what I want.

670
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:03,569
 Thwarting you has never
 been my primary ambition,
 I promise you.

671
00:47:03,637 --> 00:47:05,337
 Although who
 doesn't like to see

672
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,039
 their friends
 fail now and then?

673
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:08,791
               You're so right.

674
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,494
 For instance,
 when I thwarted your plan

675
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,363
 to give Sansa Stark
 to the Tyrells.

676
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,132
 If I'm going to be honest,

677
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,836
 I did feel an unmistakable
 sense of enjoyment there.

678
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,506
 But your confidant,

679
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:28,077
 the one who fed
 you information
 about my plans,

680
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:30,680
 the one you
 swore to protect...

681
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,216
 You didn't bring
 her any enjoyment.

682
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,787
 And she didn't
 bring me any enjoyment.

683
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:42,191
 She was a bad investment
 on my part.

684
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:49,615
 Luckily, I have a friend
 who wanted to
 try something new.

685
00:47:50,518 --> 00:47:53,552
              Something daring.

686
00:47:53,621 --> 00:48:00,158
         And he was so grateful
         to me for providing
         this fresh experience.

687
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:07,633
 I did what I did for
 the good of the realm.

688
00:48:07,702 --> 00:48:09,818
               The realm?

689
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,087
             Do you know
             what the realm is?

690
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:17,326
          It's the 1,000 blades
          of Aegon's enemies.

691
00:48:17,378 --> 00:48:22,548
             A story we agree
             to tell each other
             over and over,

692
00:48:22,616 --> 00:48:24,867
             till we forget
             that it's a lie.

693
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:29,438
 But what do we have left
 once we abandon the lie?

694
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:33,942
 Chaos. A gaping pit
 waiting to swallow us all.

695
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,645
            Chaos isn't a pit.

696
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,798
           Chaos is a ladder.

697
00:48:42,135 --> 00:48:46,905
  Many who try to climb it fail
  and never get to try again.

698
00:48:48,242 --> 00:48:50,442
          The fall breaks them.

699
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:05,757
             And some are given
             a chance to climb,
             but they refuse.

700
00:49:05,826 --> 00:49:12,631
        They cling to the realm
        or the Gods or love.

701
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:15,000
                   Illusions.

702
00:49:16,771 --> 00:49:19,488
       Only the ladder is real.

703
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:23,074
     The climb is all there is.
