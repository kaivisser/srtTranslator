                     The queen.

139
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,350
 TYRION: What are
 they doing here?

140
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,202
    Protecting me, I assume.
    Will you let me in?

141
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:18,606
       No, I don't think so.

142
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:22,443
     If I wanted to kill you,
     do you think I'd let
     a wooden door stop me?

143
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,184
 They stay outside.

144
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:32,270
      I'm not afraid of you,
      little brother.

145
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,463
          (CREAKING)

146
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,303
              Why are you here?

147
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:51,005
 I wanted to see your face.

148
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:53,174
 They said you'd
 lost your nose,

149
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:55,593
 but it's not as
 gruesome as all that.

150
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,912
       The man who cut me
       lost more than his nose.

151
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,181
 I should hope so.

152
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:03,584
 The rebels came
 for Joffrey's head,
 they lost their own.

153
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,918
 Thanks to Father.

154
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,821
            Thanks to Father.

155
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,926
   Of course, it wasn't a rebel
   who tried to kill me.

156
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,529
   No? Curious.

157
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:18,316
 Bit of a comedown
 from chamber of the Hand.

158
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:20,735
 But then I don't suppose
 you need much room.

159
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:23,404
          Grand Maester Pycelle
          made the same joke.

160
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:26,991
   You must be proud to
   be as funny as a man
   whose balls brush his knees.

161
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:28,709
 You're meeting
 Father today?

162
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,995
          How do you know that?

163
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:33,947
 Because I have
 hundreds of spies
 in my employ.

164
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:37,635
 The Master of Whisperers
 owes me a favor or two.

165
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:41,856
 Father told me.
 What do you want from him?

166
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:43,775
       What do I want from him?
       He's my father.

167
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,126
                Do I need to
                want something?

168
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:53,350
   I'm sure he loves me dearly,
   as any father loves
   his child, his baby boy.

169
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,138
          Yet he hasn't
          come to visit once...

170
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,973
      Hmm.
             ...since arriving
             in King's Landing.

171
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,992
         I lay here,
         my face split in half,

172
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:04,428
         but Father never came.

173
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,136
                You're going to
                make me cry.

174
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,638
 Why do you care
 what I want from him?

175
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,209
            Because
            you've slandered me
            to Father before.

176
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,428
 Slandered? When?

177
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:24,365
   You told him I had my guards
   beat that servant girl
   at Casterly Rock.

178
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:27,701
 You did have your
 guards beat her.
 A girl of nine, I believe.

179
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,570
               I was nine, too.

180
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,505
 She lost an eye,
 if I remember correctly.

181
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,340
       If I remember correctly,

182
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,109
              she never stole
              a necklace again.
              (LAUGHS)

183
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:39,814
 It's not slander
 if it's true.

184
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:42,700
   And what's this truth
   you plan on
   telling him today?

185
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,537
 Why are you so nervous
 about what I'm
 going to say to Father?

186
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,806
   Because you're a liar.

187
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,076
    I expect you'll
    tell lies about me,
    about Joffrey.

188
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,545
 Any lies in particular?

189
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:58,800
       (SIGHS) You're
       a clever man,

190
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:00,901
    but not as clever
    as you think you are.

191
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,871
 Mmm. Still makes me
 more clever than you.

192
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,339
          (DOOR OPENS)

193
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,659
             Ah.

194
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,978
     Look at these two
     shining warriors.

195
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:15,817
   Ser Taryn Mant and
   Ser Whosit of Whocares.

196
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:17,801
             Ser Meryn Trant.

197
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,871
     Ser Bronn
     of the Blackwater.

198
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,673
              You're no knight.
           Pod.

199
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:26,043
    Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
    was anointed by
    the king himself.

200
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:30,230
           You're an
           up-jumped cutthroat,
           nothing more.

201
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
 That's exactly who I am.

202
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:34,285
 And you're
 a grub in fancy armor

203
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:37,604
 who's better at
 beating little girls
 than fighting men.

204
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:40,340
 Now, I have an appointment
 with Lord Tyrion.

205
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,043
         You put your
         hand on that door,

206
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,444
             you lose the hand.

207
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,248
        As much as I appreciate
        a walk in the sunshine,

208
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,317
           I am wondering
           why you sent for me.

209
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:10,455
 Many people in this
 city want to kill me.
 You're here to protect me.

210
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,256
          I've been doing
          that for a while now.

211
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,658
 Do you grow
 bored protecting me?

212
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,242
     I grow poor
     protecting you.

213
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,611
         Poor? Poor?

214
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,413
 Under my patronage
 you've become a knight,

215
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:21,481
 you've served as Commander
 of the City Watch.

216
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:22,917
      Briefly.

217
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:24,317
     I'm sure you
     filled your pockets.

218
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:26,453
 And now my pockets
 are empty.

219
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,789
 You've given me
 a taste for
 the finer things.

220
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,343
       And if you want me
       protecting you,
       you'll need to pay more.

221
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,544
 I thought we were friends.

222
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,878
                   We are.

223
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,048
           But I'm a sellsword.
           I sell my sword.

224
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,283
         I don't loan it out
         to friends as a favor.

225
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:40,751
 How much?
       Double.

226
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,886
 Double?

227
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,053
   I'm a knight now.

228
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,488
   Knights are
   worth double.

229
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,924
 I don't even know
 how much I'm
 paying you now.

230
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,026
  Which means
  you can afford it.

231

      (GASPS)

234
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,466
            Here. Here!

235
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,127
       Help me!

236
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,320

239
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,168
               Who are you?

240
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,908
 I was in
 the battle at Blackwater.

241
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,963
 I was a captain
 and a knight.

242
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:18,949
        Aye, ser,
        and serving which king?

243
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,091
  The one true king
  of Westeros,

244
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:33,113
 Stannis Baratheon.

245
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,291
       I thought you were dead.

246
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,794
         Everyone
         thought you were dead.

247
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,299
                 And your son?

248
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,924
             He may have swam
             ashore as you did.

249
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,861
 No, the wildfire took him.
 I saw it.

250
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,690
       I'm so sorry, my friend.

251
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,894
       I, too, have lost a son.
       There is nothing
       worse in this world.

252
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:27,318
        But, Davos,
        you were a good father.

253
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,354
 If I was a good father,
 he'd still be here.

254
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:34,574
 Stannis lives?

255
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:36,110
            He licks his wounds
            at Dragonstone.

256
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:38,362
 Will you take me there?

257
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,865
         There is nothing
         for me at Dragonstone.

258
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,416
 This war is not over.

259
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:46,686
        Not for you, maybe.
        But for Salladhor Saan,
        the war is over.

260
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:48,605
 We're both sworn
 to King Stannis.

261
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,008
          I am sworn to no man.

262

        I promised you 30 ships
        and you promised me
        riches and glory.

263
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,396
         I delivered the ships.

264
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:58,632
 Stannis never
 gives up. Never.

265
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,900
 Now he will regroup...

266
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:01,268
             He's a broken man.

267
00:22:01,337 --> 00:22:03,721
             His fleet lies
             at the bottom
             of Blackwater Bay.

268
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:07,408
       They say he sees no one,
       not his generals,
       not even his wife.

         Only the Red Woman

270
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,547
 whispering in his ear,
 telling him what
 she sees in the flames

271
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:16,534
         and burning men alive.

272
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,801
         What?

273
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,555
        They built a great fire
        when Stannis returned.

274
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:26,927
         All those who spoke
         against her she called
         servants of darkness.

275
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,899
           They say she sang to
           them as they burned.

276
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,372
                 I'm a pirate.

277
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:42,643
          You're a smuggler.
          Servants of darkness.

278
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:45,612
       I'm thinking Dragonstone
       is a good place
       for us to avoid.

279
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:47,097
 Take me back there, please.

280
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,666
       (SCOFFS) You cannot turn
       Stannis against her.

281
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,918
 Maybe not, but
 I could carve her heart out.

282
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:53,820
                 You could try.

283
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:56,423
            If you fail,
            they will burn you.

284
00:22:56,492 --> 00:22:59,226
              If you succeed,
              they'll burn you.

285
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,428
        And you've only
        just come back to life.

286
00:23:01,497 --> 00:23:03,697
    (CHUCKLES) Stay alive
    a little longer, my friend.

287
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,483
 You call me friend.
 You drank with me
 on my wedding day.

288
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,602
          And you drank with me
          on four of mine,

289
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:10,755
                but I don't ask
                you for favors.

290
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:14,959
 I have to stop her.
 Please, do this for me.

291
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,714
             When you are dead,

292
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:23,216
         I will gather your
         bones in a little sack

293
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:26,186
     and let your widow
     wear them around her neck.

294
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:42,453
          We should set
          the siege lines 1,000
          yards from Harrenhal.

295
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,255
 There won't be a siege.
 The Mountain
 can't defend a ruin.

296
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:48,692
       The Mountain will defend
       whatever Tywin Lannister
       tells him.

297
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,161
 The Lannisters
 have been running
 from us since Oxcross.

298
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,815
 I'd love a fight.
 The men would love a fight.

299
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:56,416
 I don't think
 we're going to get one.

           (FLY BUZZING)

 RICKARD: Two hundred Northmen
 slaughtered like sheep.

303
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:52,022
 The debt will be repaid,
 my friend.

304
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,925
 For them and for your sons.

305

                     Will it?

306
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,832
         They rot in the ground
         while their killer
         runs free.

307
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:04,668
 The Kingslayer won't
 remain free for long.

308

 My best hunters
 are after him.

     Find her a chamber
     that will serve as a cell.

      The Lannisters
      robbed them of their sons

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,740
            and she robbed them
            of their justice.

 QYBURN: Water.

00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:23,563
 (WHISPERS) Water.

321
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:26,166
            This needs to be
            cleaned and closed.

322

      What's your name, friend?

                The badge looks
                good on you.

327
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,114
              Almost as good as
              it looked on me.

328
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,370
             Are you enjoying
             your new position?

329
00:27:21,256 --> 00:27:22,623
    Am I enjoying it?

330
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:23,941
           I was very happy
           as Hand of the King.

331
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,959
 (TYWIN CHUCKLES)

332
00:27:26,027 --> 00:27:29,262
 Yes.
 I heard how happy you were.

 (BLOWS)

334
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,317
 You brought
 a whore into my bed.

335
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,020
             It wasn't your bed
             at the time.

336
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:42,342
 I sent you here
 to advise the king.

337
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,895
 I gave you real
 power and authority.

338
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,465
 You chose to
 spend your days

339
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,500
 as you always have,

340
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:55,088
 bedding harlots and
 drinking with thieves.

341
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,960
           Occasionally I drank
           with the harlots.

342
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:02,312
 What do you want, Tyrion?

343
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:05,415
       Why does everyone assume
       I want something?

344
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:08,284
        Can't I simply visit
        with my beloved father?

345
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:12,021
          My beloved father who

346
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,391
          somehow forgot to
          visit his wounded son

347
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,693
               after he fell on
               the battlefield.

348
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:20,130
 Maester Pycelle assured me
 your wounds were not fatal.

349
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,717
       I organized
       the defense of this city

350
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,619
        while you held court in
        the ruins of Harrenhal.

351
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:29,156
               I led the foray
               when the enemies
               were at the gate

352
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:34,795
     while your grandson,
     the king, quivered in fear
     behind the walls.

353
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:38,698
              I bled in the mud
              for our family.

354
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:43,103
         And as my reward,
         I was trundled off to
         some dark little cell.

355
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,773
            But what do I want?

356
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:49,375
      A little bloody gratitude
      would be a start.

357
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:52,612
 Jugglers and singers
 require applause.

358
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:55,815
 You are a Lannister.

359
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:58,285
 Do you think I demanded
 a garland of roses

360
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:00,720
 every time I suffered
 a wound on a battlefield?

361
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:02,839
 Hmm?

362
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,642
 Now, I have seven
 kingdoms to look after

363
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,079
 and three of them
 are in open rebellion.

364
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:13,800
 So tell me what you want.

365
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:20,506
            I want what is mine
            by right.

366
00:29:22,244 --> 00:29:25,862
      Jaime is your eldest son,
      heir to your lands
      and titles.

367
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:30,017
       But he is a Kingsguard,
       forbidden from
       marriage or inheritance.

368
00:29:30,085 --> 00:29:32,385
            The day Jaime put
            on the white cloak,

369
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,721
           he gave up his claim
           to Casterly Rock.

370
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:39,058
               I am your son
               and lawful heir.

371
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,513
 You want Casterly Rock?

372
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,482
           It is mine by right.

373
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,187
           (SIGHS)

374
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:54,324
 We'll find you accommodations
 more suited to your name

375
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:57,143
 and as a reward for
 your accomplishments

376
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,781
      during the battle
      of Blackwater Bay.

377
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:05,101
 And when the time is right,
 you will be given a position
 fit for your talents

378
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,889
   so that you can
   serve your family
   and protect our legacy.

379
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:14,895
 And if you serve faithfully,
 you will be rewarded
 with a suitable wife.

380
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:17,364
   And I would let myself
   be consumed by maggots

381
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:22,019
 before mocking the family
 name and making you
 heir to Casterly Rock.

382
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:25,004
                     Why?

383
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,306
        Why?

384
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:28,608
 You ask that?

385
00:30:28,677 --> 00:30:31,861
 You, who killed your mother
 to come into the world?

386
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:36,082
      You are an ill-made,
      spiteful little creature

387
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:40,337
 full of envy,
 lust, and low cunning.

388
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:44,223
 Men's laws give you
 the right to bear my name
 and display my colors

389
00:30:44,293 --> 00:30:47,227
 since I cannot prove
 that you are not mine.

390
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:51,414
 And to teach me humility,
 the Gods have condemned me

391
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,951
 to watch you waddle about
 wearing that proud lion

392
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,788
 that was my father's sigil
 and his father's before him.

393
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,690
 But neither Gods nor men

394
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,643
 will ever compel me to
 let you turn Casterly Rock

395
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:05,511
 into your whorehouse.

396
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:09,315
       Go, now.

397
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,273
 Speak no more of
 your rights to Casterly Rock.

398
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:19,892
        Go.

399
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:30,470
 One more thing.

400
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:37,444
 The next whore I catch
 in your bed I'll hang.

401
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:48,054
 SANSA: Dorne.
 It's going to Dorne.

402
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:49,489
               SHAE: Why Dorne?

403
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:50,857
 It's carrying silk

404
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:54,427
 and it's supposed to bring
 back wine in exchange.

405
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,917
      But it's not coming back.

406
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,386
            The captain's tired
            of risking his life

407
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,555
              so King's Landing
              lords and ladies

408
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,858
             can get drunk
             on better wine
             than they deserve.

409
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,228
                 He's going to
                 stay in Dorne.

410
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,765
           Wait out the winter
           where it's beautiful
           and warm.

411
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:19,502
 I met some people in Dorne
 who weren't so
 beautiful and warm.

412
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,904
           Don't ruin the game.

413
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:24,574
 I told you,
 I don't want to play.

414
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,477
 What about that one there?

415
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,964
        SHAE: That one?
        It's going to Volantis.

416
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,632
                       Why?

417
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,869
 Because when I got
 on a ship in Volantis,
 it looked like that one.

418
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:38,438
            That's not
            how the game works.

419
00:32:38,507 --> 00:32:42,108
    You're not supposed to just
    blurt out the right answer.

420
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:47,297
     You've got to invent
     a story about where
     the ship is going and why.

421
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:51,118
 Why should I make up a story
 when I know the truth?

422
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:54,788
            Because the truth
            is always either
            terrible or boring.

423
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:56,523
 Lovely day for it.

00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:07,150
            Might I speak
            with Lady Sansa
            alone for a moment?

427
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,665
             I saw your mother
             not long ago.

428
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,368
               She's very eager
               to see you.

429
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,955
               And your sister.

430
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,708
      Arya's alive?

431
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,682
 You said you'd take me home.

432
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,985
        You said King's Landing
        was your home.

433
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,722
     You are the property
     of the crown. Stealing you
     would be treason.

434
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,357
            If you were to tell
            just one person...

435
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,625
 I won't tell anyone.

436
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,826
                 How do I know?

437
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:52,095
 Because I'm a terrible liar.

438
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,731
 You said so yourself.

439
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,268
          Please, Lord Baelish.
          Tell me what to do.
          Tell me when.

440
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,839
 I'm waiting for
 word on an assignment

441
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,808
 that will take me
 far away from the capital.

442
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:10,313
 When I set sail,
 I might be able to
 take you with me.

443
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,566
 But you'll need to
 be ready to leave
 on a moment's notice.

444
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,771
 You're her handmaiden?

445
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,843
         Yes. And you're his...

446
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:24,945
 I help manage his affairs.

447
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:27,581
      He's an important person.

448
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,582
 So is she.

449
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,451
 I grew up in the shadow
 of her father's castle.

450
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:36,839
 The day she was born,
 they rang the bells
 from sunrise till sunset.

 rather well, you and I.

                     Yes.

453

 Given where we started.

454
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,021
             And where is that?

455
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:57,193
 It's not easy
 for girls like us
 to dig our way out.

456
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,884
 Watch out for her.

457
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:06,719
                   I always do.

00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:10,140
 Watch out for her with him.

              I need an army.

            We'll be in Astapor
            by nightfall.

467

     I do not judge people
     for the Gods they worship.

496
00:38:35,597 --> 00:38:37,947
          If I did, I'd have
          thrown you in the sea

497
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,316
           before you ever set
           foot on Dragonstone.

 I'm not your enemy.

              You are my enemy.

 on Blackwater Bay?

501
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,162

             your ships ablaze?

502
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,868
 I wasn't there
 when the wildfire

 killed our men
 by the thousands.

 I could have
 saved those men.

 the city, Stannis would sit

 swallowed them.
