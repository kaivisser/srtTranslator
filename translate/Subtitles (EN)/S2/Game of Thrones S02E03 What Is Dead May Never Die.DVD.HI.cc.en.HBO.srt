00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,214
        Lady Catelyn.
        I'm pleased to see you.

145
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,434
   May I present my wife,
   Margaery of House Tyrell?

146
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,522
      You are very
      welcome here, Lady Stark.

147
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,157
    I'm so sorry for your loss.

148
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,410
            You are most kind.

149
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,880
             RENLY: My lady,

150
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:15,650
     I swear to you I will
     see the Lannisters answer
     for your husband's murder.

151
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,487
    When I take King's Landing,

152
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:21,289
 I'll bring you Joffrey's head.

153
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:22,590
           (CHEERING)

154
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:33,434
     It will be enough
     to know that
     justice was done, my lord.

155
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,570
           BRIENNE: Your Grace.

156
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,955
    And you should kneel
    when you approach the King.

157
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:41,292
      There's no need for that.
      Lady Stark is
      an honored guest.

158
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,196
   Has your son marched against
   Tywin Lannister yet?

159
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,865
           I do not sit on my
           son's war councils.

160
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:52,003
          And if I did,
          I would not share his
          strategies with you.

161
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,039
 If Robb Stark
 wants a pact with us,
 he should come himself,

162
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,758
 not hide behind
 his mother's skirts.

163
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:01,879
      My son is fighting a war,
      not playing at one.

164
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,431
        (MEN GRUMBLING)

166
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,212
      Don't worry, my lady.

167
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,347
    Our war is just beginning.

168

         (MEN SHOUTING)

169
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:34,495
      Your Grace.
                        Gerard.

170
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,863
               How's your foot?

171
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,464
 Better, Your Grace.

172
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,566
 They don't know
 their own size is all.

173
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:41,068
                  Good man.

174
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,739
          I have 100,000 men
          at my command.

175
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:48,042
 All the might
 of the Stormlands
 and the Reach.

176
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:51,845
 And all of them young and bold
 like your Knight of Flowers?

177
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:55,349
 It's a game to you, isn't it?

178
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,417
  I pity them.

179
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:57,484
                    Why?

180
00:13:57,553 --> 00:13:59,287
 Because it won't last.

181
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:03,090
 Because they are
 the knights of summer
 and winter is coming.

182
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:08,463
           Brienne, escort Lady
           Catelyn to her tent.

183
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:11,099
  She's tired from her journey.

184
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,616
  BRIENNE: At once, Your Grace.

185
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:13,835
          Shall I return after?

186
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:15,202
  That won't be necessary.

187
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,638
       I would pray awhile.
       Alone.

188
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,392
  If you'll follow me, my lady.

189
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:27,599
 You fought bravely today,
 Lady Brienne.

190
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,800
          I fought for my king.

191
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,503
        Soon I'll fight for him
        on the battlefield.

192
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,340
         Die for him if I must.

193
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,543
         And, if it please you,
         Brienne's enough.

194
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,346
                 I'm no lady.

195
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,895
 What are you doing here?

196
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:16,914
           I live here.

197
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,600
          Are you angry
          with me, brother?

198
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,052
 You lying bitch.

199
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,321
          It's not my fault you
          didn't recognize me.

200
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,191
 Recognize you? How could I?

201
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,993
 The last time I saw you...

202
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,930
     you looked like
     a fat little boy.

203
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,634
              You were a fat
              little boy, too,

204
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,852
          but I recognized you.

205
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,371
 Why didn't you tell me?

206
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,423
            I wanted to see
            who you were first.

207
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:44,241
         (LAUGHS) And I did.

208
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:49,663
 The plans are made.
 It's time you heard them.

209
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,649
                        Father.
            Father.

210
00:15:54,236 --> 00:15:56,437
 The wolf pup has gone south

211
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:59,640
 with the entirety
 of the Northern
 army at his back.

212
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,476
 While he's tangling with
 the lion in the Westerlands,

213
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,496
 the North is
 ripe for the taking.

214
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,682
 The ironborn will
 reave and pillage,
 as it was in the old days,

215
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:11,051
 all along the northern coast.

216
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,988
 We'll spread our dominion
 across the green lands,

217
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,874
 securing the Neck
 and everything above.

218
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:19,727
    Every stronghold
    will yield to us,
    one by one.

219
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:22,646
 Winterfell may
 defy us for a year,
 but what of it?

220
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,432
 The rest shall be ours,

221
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:27,518
 forest, field, and hall.

222
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,009
 Yara, my daughter,
 you'll take 30 longships

223
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,878
 to attack Deepwood Motte.

224
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:39,113
 I've always wanted a castle.

225
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:42,966
             And what's my role
             in all this?

226
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:46,888
 You'll take a ship to raid
 the fishing villages
 on the Stoney Shore.

227
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:48,656
                    A ship?

228
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,724
                You give her 30
                and I get one?

229
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:54,078
 The Sea Bitch.
 We thought she'd
 be perfect for you.

230
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,082
        I'm to fight fishermen?

231
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,184
 Be careful of their nets.

232
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:07,942
      Father,
      I fought with Robb Stark.
      I know his men.

233
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:09,359
 He won't give up
 the North so easily.

234
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,795
              They won't even
              know we're there

235
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,563
           until it's too late.
 What do you know of it, woman?

236
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,065
 I'm a proven warrior.

237
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,417
   Your brothers were warriors,
   both of them dead

238
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:20,904
  at the hands of those
  you seem so eager to protect.

239
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,758
 I'm not protecting anyone.

240
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,828
 I just wonder if
 it's not wiser to wait.

241
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:30,965
 Why risk going
 against the North
 if they would be our allies?

242
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:33,267
 Rise up against them
 and they could destroy us.

243
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:36,003
 But if we pledge
 fealty to them,

244
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:37,671
 they'll give us Casterly Rock.

245
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,506
            What are our words?

246
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,576
                   Our words?

247
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,597
   We do not sow.

248
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,232
                We do not sow.

249
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,934
               We are ironborn.

250
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:53,004
            We're not subjects.
            We're not slaves.

251
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,773
      We do not plow the fields
      or toil in the mine.

252
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,808
          We take what is ours.

253
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,162
      Your time with the wolves
      has made you weak.

254
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,719
 You act as if
 I volunteered to go.

255
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,073
 You gave me away,
 if you remember.

256
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:14,608
 The day you bent the knee
 to Robert Baratheon.

257
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,627
 After he crushed you.

258
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,463
 Did you take
 what was yours then?

259
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,102
 You gave me away!

260
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,704
 Your boy!

261
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:30,057
      Your last boy!

262
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:33,827
 You gave me away
 like I was some dog
 you didn't want anymore.

263
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:36,897
        And now you curse me
        because I've come home.

264
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,461
 You'd have our father
 bow down to your other family?

265
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,896
 I have no other family.

266
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,332
               Don't you?

267
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,803
 Make your choice,
 Theon, and do it quickly.

268
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,405
           Our ships sail
           with or without you.

269
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:15,168
 You won't let me
 leave this room.

270
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,654
 You won't let me...

271
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,088
               (SHUSHING) Keep
               your voice down.

272
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,328
   Why? You think your
   father can hear me?

273
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,614
 (SHOUTING) He's
 300 miles away!

274
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:28,098
                   (SIGHS)

275
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,420
             I don't intend for
             you to stay here.

276
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:35,740
           I might be able
           to bring you into
           the castle kitchens.

277
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,708
         Again, only temporary.

278
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,312
 Every man who has
 tasted my cooking

279
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,563
 has told me what
 a good whore I am.

280
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:45,299
    But you wouldn't be a cook.

281
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,185
      You'd pose as a scullion.

282
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,072
 Scullion? What is a scullion?

283
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,926
            Kitchen wench.

284
00:19:54,978 --> 00:19:56,343
 A kitchen wench?

285
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:57,778
                Yes, but...

286
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:01,949
 Cleaning pots?
 Is that how my lion
 wants to see me?

287
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:04,585
            Your lion wants
            to see you alive.

288
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:06,887
            We've come to
            a dangerous place.

289
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,822
 My sister wants to hurt me.

290
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,875
        She'll look for any
        weakness she can find.

291
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,461
      She can't know about you.

292
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,162
 I'm the weakness?

293
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,181
    It's a compliment, my lady.

294
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,034
 How is being
 a weakness a compliment?

295
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:25,322
             Language can be
             a bit tricky here.

296
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,523
           Oh.

297
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,926
 I'm too stupid to understand.

298
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,095
 The stupid foreign girl.

299
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,817
 I am not a kitchen wench.

300
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:04,678
 When will Joffrey
 and Sansa be married?

301
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:07,398
      Soon, darling,
      when the war is over.

302
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,833
 Mother says I'll have
 a new gown for the ceremony

303
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,169
 and another for the feast.

304
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:15,322
     But yours will be ivory,
     since you're the bride.

305
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,929
             The Princess
             just spoke to you.

306
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:23,597
   Pardon, Your Grace.

307
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:29,269
    I'm sure your dress will
    be beautiful, Myrcella.

308
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:32,089
   I'm counting the days
   until the fighting is done

309
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:35,676
     and I can pledge
     my love to the King
     in sight of the gods.

310
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,399
          Is Joffrey going to
          kill Sansa's brother?

311
00:21:45,288 --> 00:21:46,753
                 He might.

312
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,091
           Would you like that?

313
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,845
          No. I don't think so.

314
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,983
        Even if he does,
        Sansa will do her duty.

315
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,987
        Won't you, little dove?

316
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,855
             (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
           (GASPS)

317
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,090
    Come in.

318
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:29,046
   Who are you?

319
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,683
          I'm Shae, My Lady.
          Your new handmaiden.

320
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:35,486
 I didn't know
 I needed a new handmaiden.

321
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,522
 You're not from here.

322
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,589
                      No.

323
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,414
 What are you doing?

324
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:49,232
            Waiting for you to
            tell me what to do.

325
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:53,353
 I shouldn't have to
 tell you to do things.
 You should just do them.

326
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:56,323
                   What things?

327
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:58,209
 Change my linens,
 wash my clothing,

328
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:01,528
 scrub the floor,
 empty my chamber pot,
 brush my hair.

329
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:12,373
        No.
           You said to brush...

330
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:13,974
      Not now.

331
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:19,113
     Your chamber pot is empty.

332
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:21,831
 Clean the table.

333
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:29,807
 Have you ever been
 a handmaiden before?

334
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,325
                 Yes.
     For whom?

335
00:23:31,394 --> 00:23:33,343
                Lady Zuriff.
 Lady Zuriff?

336
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,081
                 Lady Zuriff.

337
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,302
 There is no Lady Zuriff
 in this city.

338
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,204
       She wasn't in this city.

339
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:45,539
 I don't know how they
 did things in that city,

340
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:48,375
 but in this city,
 handmaidens wait on ladies,

341
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:50,010
 not the other way around.

342
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,913
 And I don't have time
 to answer a thousand questions

343
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:55,315
 and teach you
 how to do your job.

344
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:00,137
       Do you want me to leave?

345
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,080
 Just brush my hair.

346
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,646
 TYRION: Oh!

347
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,381
 Thank the gods.

348
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:30,383
 I haven't had
 a proper shit in six days.

349
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:32,669
  I've encountered
  this problem before, my lord.

350
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,438
          The stresses of
          power often have this

351
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,375
           insalubrious effect.

352
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:41,712
   Two drops with water, daily.

353
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,380
 Right.
 I'm so grateful to have a man

354
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,349
 of your vast knowledge
 and wisdom on my side.

355
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,651
        Please.

356
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,886
            Thank you, my lord.

357
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,910
 I can trust you,
 Pycelle, can I not?

358
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:57,711
  Why, yes, of course, my lord.

359
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,980
 These are perilous times.

360
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:03,133
 And the crown must
 forge new alliances.

361
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,570
 And these alliances
 must often be
 sealed in matrimony.

362
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,573
            Matrimony, huh?

363
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,741
                  Yes.

364
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,112
 I'm trusting
 the council with these plans,
 but the Queen mustn't know.

365
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,181
 We can't have her
 meddling in affairs

366
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,117
 that could determine
 the future of the realm.
 There's too much at stake.

367
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,037
     Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes.

368
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,541
           I shall be
           silent as the grave.

369
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,812
 I'm brokering an alliance
 with House Martell of Dorne.

370
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,182
         Princess Myrcella will
         wed their youngest son
         when she comes of age,

371
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,800
         ensuring their loyalty

372
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,836
      and their army,
      should we need it.

373
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,956
   Myrcella sent away to Dorne?

374
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,995
 But remember,
 the Queen mustn't know.

375
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:50,113
                   Ooh.

376
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:52,683
      "The Queen mustn't know."

377
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:56,370
           I love conversations
           that begin this way.

378
00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:59,239
 I plan to marry
 Princess Myrcella off

379
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,691
 to Theon Greyjoy.

380
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,962
                Theon Greyjoy?

381
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,431
           Forgive me, my lord,
           but how?

382
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,033
          He grew up
          a ward of Winterfell.

383
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,535
 He fights for Robb Stark.

384
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:12,970
    Precisely.

385
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:15,489
 Theon's father
 loathes the Starks

386
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:18,725
 and will convince
 the boy to come to our side.

387
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:21,562
  Greyjoy can destroy
  the Northern army from within

388
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,264
            and we can have
            his father's ships.

389
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,867
 But remember,
 you must tell no one.

390
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,804
              Tell no one what?

391
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:33,957
 I plan to wed
 Princess Myrcella
 to Robin Arryn of the Vale.

392
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,895
 Lysa is not fond of me.

393
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,749
 But perhaps
 the promise of a royal match

394
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:44,885
 will convince her to
 let bygones be bygones.

395
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:48,889
      She imprisoned you.
      She tried to execute you.

396
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:52,225
            And you offer
            her son a princess?

397
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:55,729
 For men in our position,
 holding grudges can be

398
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:58,315
 an encumbrance,
 don't you think?

399
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:01,785
      And I suppose you want me
      to broker this agreement?

400
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,320
      Who better?

401
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:11,728
             Yes, I could sing
             this song to Lysa,
             if I cared to.

402
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,414
           What's in it for me?

403
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:20,504
 The gratitude of
 the people of Westeros
 for helping to end this war,

404
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:24,808
 the adoration of the King
 for bringing the Vale
 back into the fold...

405
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,378
       and Harrenhal.

406
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,514
           Harrenhal is cursed.

407
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,749
 Never took you for
 a superstitious man.

408
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:36,486
 By all means,
 tear it down and rebuild.
 You'll be able to afford it.

409
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:39,389
 I plan to make you
 Lord of the Riverlands.

410
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,709
          With a single stroke,
          you'd make me

411
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:44,294
            one of the greatest
            lords in the realm.

412
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:47,330
 You served my family well
 in the matter of
 the succession.

413
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,451
    So did Janos Slynt,
    and he was given Harrenhal,
    too.

414
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,970
    Until you snatched it away.

415
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,772
 I need you to
 deliver Lysa Arryn.

416
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,874
 I didn't need Janos Slynt.

417
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,679
 It's settled, then?

418
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,116
          Good.

419
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:10,137
 Oh. And remember...

420
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:12,205
 The Queen mustn't know.

421
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,136
            (BREATHING HEAVILY)

 Three great men sit in a room.

596
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:13,853
 A king,
 a priest and a rich man.

597
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:16,639
 Between them stands
 a common sellsword.

598
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:20,810
 Each great man
 bids the sellsword
 kill the other two.

599
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:23,213
 Who lives, who dies?

600
00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:25,698
      Depends on the sellsword.

601
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:29,986
 Does it? He has neither crown
 nor gold nor
 favor with the gods.

602
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,238
   He has a sword,
   the power of life and death.

 kings hold all the power?

 who was truly responsible?

 Joffrey? The executioner?
 Or something else?

 a shadow on the wall.

 anyone could spit.

 oh, he was a nice-looking boy.

00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:20,967
 He had good white teeth,
 blue eyes,

656
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:25,338
 one of those dimpled
 chins all the girls like.

657
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:31,010
 I would think about him
 when I was working,

 riding back into town.

 deep into Willem's skull

 A man can fight! Free us!

710
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,535
 Quick, give it to me.

711
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:03,505
 Give me the ax. Give me that.

712
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:14,934
 MAN: Put them on the wagon!

713
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,335
 There's more here. Come on.

714
00:49:17,404 --> 00:49:18,503
       (GRUNTS)

715
00:49:18,573 --> 00:49:19,939
          (PANTING)

716
00:49:20,007 --> 00:49:21,339
                (CHUCKLES)

717
00:49:22,777 --> 00:49:24,643
          What do we have here?

718
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,180
           No!

719
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:30,348
    That's a fine little blade.

720
00:49:32,153 --> 00:49:33,652
              Maybe I'll pick
              my teeth with it.

721
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,387
       I yield! I yield!

722
00:49:35,456 --> 00:49:37,689
 AMORY: Round up any survivors.

723
00:49:37,759 --> 00:49:39,892
 We'll take them
 back to Harrenhal.

724
00:49:39,961 --> 00:49:42,594
         You heard him.
         You're coming with us.

725
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:44,997
     I yield!

726
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,051
                   (WHIMPERING)

727
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:51,786
                          Help!

728
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,288
                  Help me!

729
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,261
 Something wrong
 with your leg, boy?

730
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,063
                Look at it.

731
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,939
 Can you walk?

732
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,974
       No. You got to carry me.

733
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:15,844
        All right.

734
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,187
                 (COUGHING)

735
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,310
 "Carry him," he says. (LAUGHS)

736
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:43,639
        We're looking for
        a bastard named Gendry.

737
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:46,542
                    Give him up

738
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:48,711
 or I'll start taking eyeballs.

739
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:02,824
     You want Gendry?

740
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:08,663
   You already got him.

741
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:14,636
 He loved that helmet.
