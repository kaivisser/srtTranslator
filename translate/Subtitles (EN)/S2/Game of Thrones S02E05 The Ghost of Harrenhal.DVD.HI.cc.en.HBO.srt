00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:10,929
         You swear it?

00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,080
 CATELYN: By the mother.

3
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,518
         My son has no interest
         in the Iron Throne.

4
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:25,961
 Then I see no reason
 for hostility between us.

5
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:28,730
 Your son can go on
 calling himself
 King in the North.

6
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:32,250
 The Starks will have dominion
 over all lands
 north of Moat Cailin,

7
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,202
 provided he swears me
 an oath of fealty.

8
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:35,470
                And the wording
                of this oath?

9
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:38,089
 The same Ned Stark swore
 to Robert 18 years ago.

10
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,861
 Cat, their friendship held
 the kingdoms together.

11
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,552
              And in return for
              my son's loyalty?

12
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:54,956
 In the morning, I'll
 destroy my brother's army.

13
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:56,774
 When that's done,

14
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,578
 Baratheon and Stark will fight
 their common enemy together,

15
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,297
             as they have done
             many times before.

 always been close,

17
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:16,060

 to reconsider this battle.

18

     with your brother.

 Tell me, Ser Loras,

69
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,744
 what do you desire
 most in this world?

                      Revenge.

71
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:42,283
 I have always found that
 to be the purest
 of motivations,

72
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:44,919
 but you won't have a chance
 to put your sword
 through Stannis,

73
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,754
 not today.

74
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,840
 You'll be cut to pieces
 before he sets foot
 on solid ground.

75
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,644
 If it is justice
 that you want,
 be smart about it.

76
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,147
      You can't avenge him
      from the grave.

00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,193
          Calling yourself king
          doesn't make you one.

83
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,297
    And if Renly wasn't a king,
    I wasn't a queen.

92

         of his own Kingsguard,

93
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,831
         while still others say
         it was Stannis himself
         who did it

94
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,099
             after negotiations
             went sour.

95
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,001
 Whomever did it,
 I say well done.

96
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,820
      It's not what Varys says.

97
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,573
           He says Renly's army
           is flocking to
           support Stannis,

98
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,910
       which would give Stannis
       superiority over us
       on both land and sea.

99
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,279
 Littlefinger says we can
 outspend him three to one.

100
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,615
    And I say Father raised you
    to have too much respect
    for money.

101
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,135
      Stannis Baratheon
      is coming for us,
      sooner rather than later.

102

 Aren't there other things
 you should be doing,

103
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,955
 like sealing my
 daughter in a crate
 so you can ship her away?

104
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,390
      She'll be safer in Dorne.

105
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,209
         Yes, I know
         how concerned you are
         for her safety.

106
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,078
       It so happens that I am.

 Aren't you always
 so clever with your
 schemes and your plots?

111
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,125
            Schemes and plots
            are the same thing.

 They are going to attack us.

113
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:07,761
 We need to be ready.

114
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,098

             yourself over it.

 what the king has in mind?

        You may, specifically,
        or you may ask vaguely.

 we talk about this.

120
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,623
           It's the king's

121
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:39,227
          to withhold

 you're fucking her, I mean.

         is being commissioned.

139
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,707
 I suppose there's
 only one way to find out.

140
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:28,509
    They have thousands of pots
    already stored
    in their vaults.

141
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:30,478
 They are planning to launch it
 from the city walls

142
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,313
              into Stannis'
              ships and armies.

143
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,148
                    Please.

144
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:37,702
 When did she tell you this?

145
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:42,407
           I heard her talking
           with the pyromancer.

146
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,928
          And the other night,
          after I left her,
          she went to meet him.

147
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,046
                I swear to you.

148
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,681
 Swear to me on what?

149
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,982
               On my life.

150
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,751
    But I don't care
    about your life.

151
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,338
 In the light of the Seven,
 by all that is holy and right,

152
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,891
           I, Lancel Lannister,
           do solemnly vow...

153
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,778
 All right, all right. Enough.
 Even torturing you is boring.

154
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:05,446
 Just get out.

155
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,467
            (GRUNTS)

156
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,985
 Oh, Lancel,
 tell my friend Bronn

157
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:14,022
 to please kill you
 if anything
 should happen to me.

158
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,891
 Please kill me if anything
 should happen to Lord Tyrion.

159
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:21,145
 It will be
 my pleasure.

160
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:27,201
               Your Grace.

161
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,936
      What is it?

162
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:31,239
            I'm sorry
            about your brother,
            Your Grace.

163
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:33,841
    I wanted to let you know
    that people grieve for him.

164
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,010
     Fools love a fool.

165
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,215
 I grieve for him as well,
 for the boy he was,
 not the man he grew to be.

166
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,416
     I need to speak to you

167
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:42,484
     about what I saw
     in that cave.

168
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:43,718
             I thought I made
             it clear to you

169
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,969
            there'd be no
            need to speak to me
            on this matter.

170
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,537
 Your Grace, I...

171
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,423
   I've never known you to need
   to hear a thing twice.

172
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,160
       And I've never known you
       to hide from the truth.

173
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:53,628
 You've come to
 lecture me on truth?

174
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,046
         I've come to tell
         you that what I saw...

175
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,264
 All my brother's bannermen
 have come to my side.

176
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:02,937
         Except the Tyrells,
         who fled like cowards.

177
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:04,505
 They won't be able
 to resist us now.

178
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:06,508
 Soon I shall be
 sitting on the Iron Throne.

179
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:08,760
       Nothing is worth
       what this will cost you,
       not even the Iron...

180
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,428
 I'll hear no more about it.

181
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,855
  MAN: Take a company of men,
  secure the perimeter.

182
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,908
            When do we sail
            for King's Landing?

183
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,477
 As soon as I've
 consolidated my troops.

184
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,729
 We'll make short work
 of the Lannisters' fleet.

185
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,498
 Once Blackwater Bay
 is cleared,

186
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:34,418
 we'll deliver our
 troops to their doorstep
 and take the city.

187
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,887
      And will you bring
      Lady Melisandre with you?

188
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,174
 That's not your concern.

189
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:43,811
     If you take King's Landing
     with her by your side,
     the victory will be hers.

190
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:44,978
     I never thought
     I'd have reason

191
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:46,964
  to doubt your loyalty.
  Was I wrong?

192
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,334
           Loyal service means
           telling hard truths.

193
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,702
     Oh, truth again.

194
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,704
     All right,
     what's the truth?

195
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,774
     The hard truth?

196
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:00,845
              She's a foreigner
              preaching her
              foreign religion.

197
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:04,581
      Some believe she whispers
      orders in your ear
      and you obey.

198
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:09,336
 What do you believe?

199
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:15,910
          You won those
          bannermen from Renly.

200
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:18,546
        Don't lose them to her.

201
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,303
 We set out for King's Landing
 without Lady Melisandre.

202
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:30,842
 And you lead the fleet
 into Blackwater Bay.

203
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,846
       Your Grace, I'm honored,
       but my time on the sea

204
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,515
       was spent evading ships,
       not attacking them.

205
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,950
                The other lords
                won't be happy.

206
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,253
 Most of those lords
 should consider
 themselves lucky

207
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,556
 I don't hang them
 for treason.

208
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,727
 Hard truths cut
 both ways, Ser Davos.

209
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,731
       GIRL: I've got it!
       I've got it!

210
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:12,032
 MAN: So it's that
 one there at the top,
 on the right.

211
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,571
         Buy my fruit, my lord.
         Fresh fruit.

212
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,141
 Stannis has more infantry,
 more ships, more horses.

213
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,976
         What do we have?

214
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:24,445
 There's that mind of yours
 you keep going on about.

215
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:27,982
      Well, I've never actually
      been able to kill people
      with it.

216
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,434
 Good thing.
 I'd be out of a job.

217
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,754
 What about your father?

218
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:35,240
       He hasn't sent
       a raven in weeks.

219
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,042
        He's very busy.

220
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:42,347
 Being repeatedly
 humiliated by Robb Stark
 is time-consuming.

221
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,249
           We won't be able
           to hold the city
           against Stannis,

222
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,816
        not the way Joffrey's
        planning on holding it.

223
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,984
               MAN: Corruption.

224
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,503
     CROWD: Yes!

225
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:53,474
              We are swollen,
              bloated, foul.

226
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:56,010
 Brother fornicates with sister
 in the bed of kings

227
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,446
        and we're surprised
        when the fruit of
        their incest is rotten?

228
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:00,614
           (CHEERING)

229
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:04,152
            Yes, a rotten king.

230
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,454
           It's hard to argue
           with his assessment.

231
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:09,457
   Not after what he did
   to your birthday present.

232
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:11,659
      The king is a lost cause.

233
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:14,061
         It's the rest of us
         I'm worried about now.

234
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,832
             A dancing king,
             prancing down his
             bloodstained halls

235
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,619
        to the tune of
        a twisted demon monkey.

236
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,770
           (LAUGHING)

237
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,856
        You have to admire
        his imagination.

238
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,675
        He's talking about you.

239
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,945
            What? Demon monkey?

240
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,347
  People think you're
  pulling the king's strings.

241
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,566
      They blame you
      for the city's ills.

242
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,969
       Blame me?
       I'm trying to save them.

243
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,254
        You don't need
        to convince me.

244
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:43,524
                  Demon monkey.

         Yeah, come on.

 THEON: You're
 the crew of the Sea Bitch?

 I'm your commander. Welcome.

249
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,598
                   Stop.

250
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,500
      Stop!

          commands you to stop!

 Where are we headed,
 Captain?

253
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,445
        The Stony Shore,
        to raid their villages.

254
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:41,081
      There'll be spoils in
      it for you, and women,
      if you do your jobs well.

255
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,101
 And who decides if
 we've done our jobs well?

256
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,238
                    I do.

 I have been reaving and raping
 since before you left
 Balon's balls, Captain.

260
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:03,004
 Don't reckon I've got
 much use for your ideas
 on how to do it.

261
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:06,290
 Don't reckon I've got much use
 for a captain at all.

262

 I'm thinking I can
 do the job of captain
 real well myself.

263
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,997
 All I need is a ship.

264
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:17,118
 You wouldn't know
 where I could find myself
 a ship now, would you?

265
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:25,025
          You could do that,
          take the ship,
          head out on your own.

266
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:27,561
   And I will hunt you down,
   drag you back here in chains

267
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,246
               and hang you

      your first command.

270
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,674
        Thank you. Kind of
        you to come see me off.

271
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,593
 Oh, I'm not here for you.

272
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,396
       I was just on my
       way to Red Harbor.

273
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:49,133
             I've got 30 ships.
             There's nowhere
             to put them here.

274
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,218
                    Too narrow.

275
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,655
 You'd better get out there.
 Wouldn't want her to
 set sail without you.

276
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:56,390
       That would never happen.

277
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,926
 My crew would wait on deck
 for a year if I asked them to.

278
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,380
      This lot, though...

279
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,200
 Enjoy the Stony Shore.

280
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,641
    Come on, I'll take you out.

281
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,759
 Who are you?

282
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,828
       Dagmer, your first mate.

283
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,298
 Why aren't you
 with the rest of them?

284
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,800
 Or did they send
 you to row me out

285
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,136
 and dump me
 halfway in the sea?

286
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,653
 That would be
 good for a laugh.

287
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:29,590
  They're not gonna respect you
  until you prove yourself.

288
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:31,258
 And how am I supposed
 to prove myself

289
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:32,860
 by pillaging
 piss-poor fishing villages?

290
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,962
              You're not.

291
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,598
 And yet that's the task
 my father has given me

292
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,801
          to prove that I'm
          a true Iron Islander.

293
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,070
 They're all
 Iron Islanders.

294
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:46,607
 Do they do as they're told
 or do they do as they like?

295
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,968
 THEON:
 The Stony Shore's not far
 from Torrhen's Square.

296
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,270
         The seat of
         the House of Tallhart,

297
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,905
        a more impressive prize
        than a few fishermen's
        daughters.

298
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,659
        What, you don't
        think we could take it?

299
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,928
 No, we could.

300
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:08,930
 We could never hold it
 for more than a few days.

301
00:19:08,998 --> 00:19:11,298
 As soon as Winterfell got
 word that we'd taken
 Torrhen's Square,

302
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:14,435
 the Starks
 would send their men
 to take it back.

303
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,287
      And then...

304
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:25,329
 Take me to my ship.

305
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,270
      The Starks have
      overextended their lines.

306
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,938
       Now that summer's over,
       they'll have a hard time

307
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,841
 keeping their
 men and horses fed.

308
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,042
   The Starks understand winter
   better than we ever will.

309
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,944
      The cold won't beat them.

310
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,749
 Our spies report
 growing discontent
 among the Northern lords.

311
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:50,271
 They want to return home
 and gather the harvest
 before the crops turn.

312
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:51,705
               And I'm sure if
               those same spies

313
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,190
               snuck into our
               own encampments,

314
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,477
    they would report
    growing discontent
    amongst the Southern lords.

315
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:58,779
         This is war,
         no one's content.

316
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,335
 We've underestimated
 the Stark boy for too long.

317
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,954
   He has a good
   mind for warfare,
   his men worship him.

318
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:09,623
   And as long as he
   keeps winning battles,

319
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:12,059
 they'll keep believing
 he is King in the North.

320
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:15,279
            You've been waiting
            for him to fail.

321
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:19,233
       He is not going to fail,
       not without our help.

322
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,855
         So how do we stop him?

323
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,291
 REGINALD: We've worked
 through the night, my lord.

324
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,660
 Perhaps we'd profit
 from some sleep.

325
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,695
           Yes, I think
           you would, Reginald.

326
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,448
  And because you're my cousin,
  I might even let you
  wake from that sleep.

327
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:39,102
            Go, I'm sure your
            wife must miss you.

328
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,088
 My wife's in Lannisport.

329
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,173
           Well, then you'd
           better start riding.

330
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:48,812
    Go, before I change my mind
    and send her your head.

331
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,147
              If your name
              wasn't Lannister,

332
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:53,800
    you'd be scrubbing out pots
    in the cook's tent. Go!

333
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,855
               Not wine, water.

334
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,841
  We'll be here for some time.

335
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:07,114
             Girl.

336
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:10,751
            Where are you from?

337
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,487
           Maidenpool, my lord.

338
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:17,658
    And who are
    the Lords of Maidenpool?
    Remind me.

339
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:19,944
         House Mooton, my lord.

340
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,728
    And what is their sigil?

341
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,118
         A red salmon.

342
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,887
   I think a Maidenpool girl
   would remember that.

343
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,007
      You're a Northerner,
      aren't you?

344
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:38,745
      Good. One more time,
      where are you from?

345
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:40,614
            Barrowton, my lord.

346
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:42,583
                  House Dustin.

347
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:45,335
         Two crossed longaxes
         beneath a black crown.

348
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,925
  And what do they say
  of Robb Stark in the North?

349
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,446
             They call him
             the Young Wolf.

350
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,816
        And?

351
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,168
        They say he rides
        into battle on the back
        of a giant direwolf.

352
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,142
  They say he can turn into
  a wolf himself when he wants.

353
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,560
            They say
            he can't be killed.

354
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:12,512
 And do you believe them?

355
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:15,583
              No, my lord.

356
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,685
          Anyone can be killed.

357
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:27,894
     Fetch that water.

358
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,688
           A girl says nothing.

359
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,227
           A girl keeps
           her mouth closed.

360
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:22,148
           No one hears,
           and friends may
           talk in secret, yes?

361
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:28,588
          A boy becomes a girl.

362
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,990
 I was always a girl.

363
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:32,710
    And I was always aware.

364
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,763
  But the girl keeps secrets.

365
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,265
      It is not for
      a man to spoil them.

366
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,568
 You're one of them now.

367
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,456
 I should have let you burn.

368
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,463
           And you fetch water
           for one of them now.

369
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,349
      Why is this right for you
      and wrong for me?

370
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,517
 I didn't have a choice.

371
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:58,769
                   You did.

372
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,805
                    I did.

373
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,406
               And here we are.

374
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,696
          A man pays his debts.

375
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:10,514
          A man owes three.

376
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:11,815
      Three what?

377
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,737
      The Red God takes
      what is his, lovely girl.

378
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:19,406
           And only death
           may pay for life.

379
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,293
          You saved me and
          the two I was with.

380
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:26,229
         You stole three deaths
         from the Red God.

381
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,551
 We have to give them back.

382
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,641
 Speak three names

383
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,944
 and the man will do the rest.

384
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,481
 Three lives I will give you,

385
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,282
 no more, no less,

386
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,117
 and we're done.

387
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,819
              I can name anyone

388
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,504
           and you'll kill him?

389
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,391
      A man has said.

390
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,246
             The one who
             tortures everyone.

391
00:24:59,315 --> 00:25:00,747
 A man needs a name.

392
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:03,150
         I don't know his name.

393
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:04,651
     They call him the Tickler.

394
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,386
 That is enough.

395
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:10,624
 Go now, girl.
 Your master is thirsty.

396
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,056
    MORMONT: He's not here yet.

397
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,759
             He'd have seen us,
             blown the horn.

398
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,327
 JON: When will he come?

399
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,080
       The Halfhand does things
       in his own time.

400
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:35,548
 My uncle told me
 stories about him.

401
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,184
         Most of them are true.

402
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:40,420
 I heard the Halfhand
 spent half of last winter
 beyond the Wall.

403
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:42,322
              The whole winter.

404
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:44,258
           He was north of
           the Skirling Pass
           when the snows came.

 three times.

          "Piss on wildfire and
          your cock burns off."

   conducted this experiment.

 it melts wood, stone,
 even steel,

 and, of course, flesh.

 it melts flesh like tallow.

         how many crazy old men

458
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:03,640
        I've seen pushing carts
        around army camps

459
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:07,244

   about jars full of pig shit.

 deal in pig shit.

 since the days of Maegor.

             To do what?

464
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:21,909
 The jars are put in catapults
 and flung at the enemy.

     How much do you have?

 If you could get real soldiers
 to man the catapults,

467
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,704
   then maybe you'd hit
   your target one time in ten,

468
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,874
 but all the real soldiers
 are in the Riverlands
 with your father.

 get a bit messy.

 flinging things at Stannis,

 right back at us.

476
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,007

              inside the walls,

                 Take this gem.

542
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:55,459
                    Look at it.

543
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:58,478
        Into its depths.

544
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,249
        So many facets.

545
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:06,352
      Look closely enough
      and you can see
      yourself in them.

546
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,123
          Often more than once.

547
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:17,397
     Should you grow tired
     of Xaro's baubles
     and trinkets,

548
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:21,634
   it would be an honor
   to host you at
   the House of the Undying.

549
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,671
     You are always welcome,
     Mother of Dragons.

550
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:31,745
       (GUESTS APPLAUDING)

551
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:34,848
             My apologies.

552
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:36,916
    Pyat Pree is one
    of the Thirteen.

553
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:40,153
 It was customary for me
 to extend him an invitation.

554
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:43,206
      Customs die slow
      deaths in Qarth.

555
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,758
 What is
 the House of the Undying?

556
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:49,696
  It is where the warlocks go
  to squint at dusty books

557
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:51,147
       and drink shade
       of the evening.

558
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:55,201
 It turns their lips blue
 and their minds soft.

559
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:59,839
 So soft, they actually believe
 their parlor tricks are magic.

560
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:05,912
 WOMAN: You watch over her.

561
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,216
 Do I know you?

562
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:11,985
                    I know you.

563
00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:14,553
                Jorah Mormont
                of Bear Island.

564
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:17,056
 Who are you?

565
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,542
      I'm no one.

566
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,078
 But she is
 the Mother of Dragons.

567
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:25,798
     She needs true protectors,
     now more than ever.

568
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:30,053
  They shall come day and night
  to see the wonder born
  into the world again.

569
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,423
             And when they see,
             they shall lust,

570
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:37,226
               for dragons are
               fire made flesh.

571
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,462
             And fire is power.

572
00:36:50,158 --> 00:36:52,258
        It looked like Stannis.

573
00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:56,012
                 To me it just
                 looked like...

574
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,634
            A shadow in
            the shape of a man.

575
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,753
 In the shape of Stannis.

576
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,427
      We should reach my
      son's camp tomorrow.

577
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,396
 Will you stay
 there long, my lady?

578
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:17,116
 Only long enough
 to tell Robb what I have seen.

579
00:37:17,185 --> 00:37:20,286
 After that,
 I will leave for Winterfell.

580
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:24,140
 My two youngest need me.

581
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,609
 I've been away from
 them for far too long.

582
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,312
 I never knew my mother.

583
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:32,115
      I'm sorry.

584
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,952
 My own mother died
 on the birthing bed

585
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,454
 when I was very young.

586
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,728
 It's a bloody business.

587
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:48,364
               What comes after
               is even harder.

588
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:53,469
 Once you're safely back
 amongst your own people,

589
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:56,306
 will you give me
 leave to go, my lady?

590
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,140
      You mean to kill Stannis.

591
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,109
     I swore a vow.

592
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:03,463
       But Stannis has
       a great army around him.

593
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,165
        His own guards are
        sworn to keep him safe.

594
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:07,533
 I'm as good
 as any of them.

595
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,171
 I should never have fled.

596
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:14,207
             Renly's death was
             no fault of yours.

597
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:16,242
        You served him bravely.

598
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:19,545
 I only held him that once

599
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:22,648
 as he was dying.

600
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,154
            He's gone, Brienne.

601
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,574
   You serve nothing and no one
   by following him
   into the earth.

602
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,812
        Renly's enemies are
        Robb's enemies as well.

603
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,602
 I do not know
 your son, my lady.

604
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:48,658
 But I could serve you,
 if you would have me.

605
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,028
 You have courage.

606
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:55,831
 Not battle courage, perhaps,
 but, I don't know,

607
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:59,435
 a woman's kind of courage.

608
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:03,039
 And I think that
 when the time comes,
 you will not hold me back.

609
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:06,576
 Promise me that you
 will not hold me back
 from Stannis.

610
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,752
      When the time comes,
      I will not hold you back.

611
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,112
 Then I am yours, my lady.

612
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:30,850
 I will shield your back
 and give my life for yours,
 if it comes to that.

613
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:33,886
 I swear it by
 the Old Gods and the new.

614
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:45,164
    I vow that you shall always
    have a place in my home

615
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:47,149
                and at my table

616
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:51,754
      and that I shall ask
      no service of you that
      might bring you dishonor.

617
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,291
      I swear it by
      the Old Gods and the new.

618
00:39:57,345 --> 00:39:58,410
            (THUDS)

619
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,147
         MAN: And it's not
         just thieves, my lord.

620
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:03,782
             There's wolves
             in them hills now,

621
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:06,052
         more than I ever seen.

622
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,755
    They come down in the night
    and they kill my sheep.

623
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,092
     My three sons is away
     fighting for your brother,
     my lord.

624
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,396
  They'll fight, keep fighting
  till they're told to go home.

625
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:19,765
         I have no one to man
         my flock now. Only me.

626
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:23,419
         I can't keep watch
         all day and all night.

627
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,491
 We can send two orphan boys
 from Winterstown home with you

628
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,392
 to help watch over
 your flock

629
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:32,095
 if you can give them
 room and board.

630
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,197
     My wife always prayed
     for more children.

631
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,634
     We'll look after them.
     Thank you, my lord.

632
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,219
      And may the gods
      bless you and yours.

633
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:44,323
 Stop it.

634
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,994
      If that's everyone,
      I'm going to go for
      a ride before dark.

635
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:50,196
                       Good.

636
00:40:50,265 --> 00:40:51,380
                Hodor.

637
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,782
                   Hodor.

638
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:54,851
              Ah! Lord Stark.

639
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,986
              Torrhen's Square
              is under siege.

640
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,739
             Torrhen's Square
             is barely 40
             leagues from here.

641
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:03,042
         How can the Lannisters
         strike so far north?

642
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:05,478
       Might be a raiding party
       led by the mountain.

643
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,613
       Might be sellswords
       paid by Tywin Lannister.

644
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,798
 We have to help them.

645
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:10,566
        Most of the fighting
        men are away with Robb,

646
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,285
               but I can gather
               200 decent men.

647
00:41:12,354 --> 00:41:13,987
           Do you need so many?

648
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,489
 If we can't protect
 our own bannermen,
 why should they protect us?

649
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,559
    Go, Ser Rodrik.
    Take the men you need.

650
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,780
      Won't take long, my lord.
      Southerners don't
      do well up here.

651
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,558
         (BIRD SQUAWKS)

652
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:37,259
             BRAN: So,
             what does it mean?

653
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,313
 Ask your Maester Luwin.
 He's the one studying
 books all the time.

654
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:43,867
          I did ask him.
          He'd never heard of
          a three-eyed raven.

655
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:46,202
 Must not mean
 anything, then.

656
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:47,636
              You're lying.

657
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:50,406
 You might be a little lord,
 but don't you call me a liar.

658
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:51,874
        You know what it means.

659
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,526
 I never said I didn't.

660
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,545
     You didn't give me
     an honest answer.

661
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,047
 That's not the same
 as being a liar.

662
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,749
        Well, it's not far off.

663
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:03,286
 So, you've been dreaming
 of a three-eyed raven again?

664
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:09,175
 In the godswood,
 you told me you didn't dream.

665
00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:10,693
 Now who's a liar?

666
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:16,498
     What did you see
     in your dream?

667
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,886
       Something bad?

668
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,622
      Tell me, boy.

669
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,612
    I dreamt that
    the sea came to Winterfell.

670
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:34,884
     I saw waves
     crashing against the gates

671
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:37,620
      and the water came
      flowing over the walls...

672
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,258
         It flooded the castle.

673
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,029
            Drowned men
            were floating here,

674
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:49,098
                   in the yard.

675
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,936
    Ser Rodrik was one of them.

676
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:59,591
 The sea is
 hundreds of miles away.

677
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,393
                 I know.

678
00:43:01,462 --> 00:43:02,762
      It's just a stupid dream.

679
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,363
 I've got to get these
 potatoes to the kitchen.

680
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:06,282
 Otherwise they'll
 put me in chains again.

681
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:08,200
                       Osha.

682
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:09,468
          The three-eyed raven,

683
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,173
      what do they say about it
      north of the Wall?

684
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,662
   They say all sorts
   of crazy things
   north of the Wall.

685
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:28,287
          (WIND HOWLING)
 (HORSES NEIGHING)

686
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:31,790
         QHORIN: There.

687
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,092
 MORMONT: Where?

688
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,628
       On that mountain.

689
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,463
 SAMWELL:
 I don't see very well.

690
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:38,564
 JON: A fire.

691
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:44,203
 There's a fire.

692
00:43:44,272 --> 00:43:47,773
 The people sitting around it
 have better eyes
 than yours or mine.

693
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:50,710
    When they see us coming,
    that fire becomes a signal.

694
00:43:50,778 --> 00:43:54,379
        Gives Mance Rayder
        plenty of time to throw
        a party in our honor.

695
00:43:54,448 --> 00:43:56,481
 How many wildlings
 have joined him?

696
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,551
         From what we can tell,
         all of them.

697
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:07,493
  Mance has gathered them all
  like deer against the wolves.

698
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,245
           They're almost ready
           to make their move.

699
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:11,497
 Where?

700
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,165
                Somewhere safe.

701
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,018
               Somewhere south.

702
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:18,121
              Can't just march
              into their midst.

703
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,655
              And we can't wait
              for them here

704
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:22,525
       with nothing but a pile
       of stones to protect us.

705
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,244
 You saying we should
 fall back to the Wall?

706
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:28,481
      Mance was one of us once.

707
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:30,649
          Now he's one of them.

708
00:44:30,718 --> 00:44:33,586
       He's going to teach them
       our way of doing things.

709
00:44:33,654 --> 00:44:37,589
        They'll hit us in force
        and they won't run away
        when we hit back.

710
00:44:37,658 --> 00:44:42,244
         They're gonna be more
         organized than before,
         more disciplined,

711
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:44,346
               more like us.

712
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:48,284
           So we need to be
           more like them,
           do things their way.

713
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:51,954
          Sneak in, kill Mance,

714
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:55,824
       and scatter them
       to the winds before they
       can march on the Wall.

715
00:44:55,894 --> 00:44:58,778
              And to do that...
    We need to get rid
    of those lookouts.

716
00:44:58,847 --> 00:45:01,230
                 It's not a job
                 for 400 men.

717
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,450
               I need to move
               fast and silent.

             Harker,
             Stonesnake, Borba.

719
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,374
 Lord Commander,
 I'd like to join
 Lord Qhorin.

720
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,176
               I've been called
               lots of things,

721
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:16,345
          but that might be
          my first Lord Qhorin.

722
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:17,513
       (LAUGHING)

723
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,898
    You're a steward,
    Snow, not a ranger.

724
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,667
   I've fought and
   killed a wight.

725
00:45:21,736 --> 00:45:23,685
    How many rangers
    can say that?

726
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,087
                  He's the one?

727
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,842
     Aye. You killed a wight.

728
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:33,745
   You also let an old
   man beat you bloody
   and take your sword.

729
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,347
         (ALL LAUGHING)

730
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,682
        QHORIN: Craster?

731
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,117
     In the boy's defense,
     that's a tough old goat.

732
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:45,141
   I could take up Jon's duties
   while he's gone, my lord.

733
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,444
        It would be no trouble.

734
00:45:57,655 --> 00:46:01,456
 Well, I hope you
 make a better ranger
 than you do a steward.

735
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,877
      Go on.

736
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,337
 XARO: So, tell me,

737
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:17,974
 how long has your manservant
 been in love with you?

738
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:21,677
  He's not my manservant
  and he's not in love with me.

739
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,846
           He's my advisor,

740
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,181
              my friend.

741
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:26,815
       Unlikely.

742
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,751
 I can almost always tell
 what a man wants.

743
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,054
            And what about
            what a woman wants?

744
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,023
 Much more complicated.

745
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:39,028
   You, for example,
   what do you want?

746
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:41,730
 To cross the Narrow Sea
 and take back the Iron Throne.

747
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,232
     Why?

748
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,201
   Because I promised
   my khalasar I'd protect them

749
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,268
     and find them a safe home.

 (CHUCKLES)

751
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:50,590
 You want to conquer
 the Seven Kingdoms
 for the Dothraki?

752
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:53,108
 I want them because
 they're mine by right.

753
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:56,211
 The Iron Throne is mine
 and I will take it.

754
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,547
               Ah, a conqueror.

755
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:01,083
 And how did you
 get all of this?
 Did someone give it to you?

756
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:05,921
       No. I come from nothing.
       I hit the docks
       like a piece of cargo,

757
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,140
  except someone normally cares
  what happens to cargo.

758
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:11,194
   So you wanted
   more than you had
   and you took it.

759
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:14,997
 You're a conqueror, too.
 You're just less ambitious.

 What do you want,

762
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,157
 At the gates of the city,
 you bled for me.

763
00:47:25,226 --> 00:47:26,225
      Why?

764
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,413
           I will show you why.

765
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:37,803
     The door and the vault
     is made of Valyrian stone.

766
00:47:37,872 --> 00:47:41,807
          The hardest steel
          does not make a mark.

767
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:44,610
         I offered the greatest
         locksmiths in Qarth

768
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:47,079
      their weight in gold if
      they could break into it.

769
00:47:47,148 --> 00:47:50,032
       I made the same offer
       to the greatest thieves.

770
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:52,801
             They all went home
             empty-handed.

771
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,787
            The only thing that
            can open this door

772
00:47:55,856 --> 00:47:57,890
               is this key.

773
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,025
 And behind the door?

                (XARO CHUCKLES)

775
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:04,563
 And it can all be mine?

776
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,482
          All? Let us say half.

777
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:14,256
               More than enough
               to buy horses,
               ships, armies...

778
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,024
             Enough to go home.

779
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:18,895
 All I have to do?

780
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:20,596
                Is marry me.

781
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,133
 That was
 a romantic proposal.

782
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:26,101
           I've already married
           once for love,

783
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,037
             but the gods
             stole her from me.

784
00:48:31,425 --> 00:48:33,292
           I come from nothing.

785
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,228
   My mother and father
   never owned a pair of shoes.

786
00:48:36,297 --> 00:48:39,631
            But marry me,
            and I will give you
            the Seven Kingdoms

787
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,068
               and our children
               will be princes
               and princesses.

 Rich men do not become rich
 by giving more than they get.

804

 They'll give you
 ships and soldiers
 and they'll own you forever.

 Moving carefully

00:49:39,293 --> 00:49:41,526
    And if I'd
    listened to that advice
    outside the gates of Qarth,

807
00:49:41,595 --> 00:49:43,245
       we'd all be dead by now.

808
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,097
 I know the opportunity
 before you

809
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:46,582
 seems like the last
 you'll ever have,

810
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,035
 but you must...
             Do not speak to me
             like I'm a child.

811
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:54,373
                 I only want...
 What do you want?

812
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:57,176
 Tell me.

813
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,744
            To see you
            on the Iron Throne.

814
00:49:58,812 --> 00:50:00,246
              Why?

815
00:50:00,314 --> 00:50:01,614
         You have a good claim.

816
00:50:01,682 --> 00:50:03,915
                  A title.
                  A birthright.

817
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,170
      But you have
      something more than that.

818
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:12,241
      You may cover it up
      and deny it, but you have
      a gentle heart.

819
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,460
          You would not only be
          respected and feared,
          you would be loved.

820
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:19,481
           Someone who can rule
           and should rule.

821
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,517
     Centuries come and go
     without a person like that
     coming into the world.

822
00:50:24,138 --> 00:50:26,338
             There are times
             when I look at you

823
00:50:26,407 --> 00:50:28,574
           and I still can't
           believe you're real.

824
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:43,906
 So what would
 you have me do,
 as my advisor?

825
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,764
             Make your own way.

826
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:54,600
            Find your own ship.
            You only need one.

827
00:50:54,669 --> 00:50:57,469
        The allies we need are
        in Westeros, not Qarth.

828
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,640
 And how do I get the ship?

829
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,892
          I'll find it for you.

830
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:06,278
           A sound ship
           with a good captain.

831
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:14,253
     I look forward
     to meeting him.

832
00:51:17,859 --> 00:51:19,624
                 Khaleesi.

        (WATER SIZZLING)

835
00:51:49,557 --> 00:51:51,489
 You should stand sideface.

836
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:52,558
                      Sideface?

837
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,077
      Sideways.

838
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:57,479
                         Why?

839
00:51:57,548 --> 00:51:59,381
 Smaller target.

840
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,569
         Am I fighting someone?

841
00:52:03,637 --> 00:52:04,753
   You're practicing
   for a fight.

842
00:52:07,241 --> 00:52:08,339
 You should practice right.

         MAN: Guards!

845
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:17,449
          Did you see anything?

846
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,388
        Go up there. Go and
        see where he fell from.

847
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:28,694
       Go up the battlement.

848
00:52:37,271 --> 00:52:38,687
      Move away.

849
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:42,857
  Stand back. He's dead.
