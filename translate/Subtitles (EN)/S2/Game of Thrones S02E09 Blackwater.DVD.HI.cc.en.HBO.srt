 dodging the royal fleet.

 sailing right at them.

11

       This is the royal fleet.

       a smuggler anymore,

            on the Iron Throne

16

         King's Landing did not

22
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,452

 they don't see a liberator,

 to set their city on fire.

 If the city falls,
 Stannis will

37

 burn every Lannister
 he can find.

49
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,578
    it is not only
    the sworn duty of a maester

50
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,682
       to carry out the wishes
       of the house he serves,

51

00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,569
                     A wedding.
        Exactly.

142
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,974
             Podrick,
             is that it?

143
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,960
               "Is that it?"
               Nice touch.

144
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:28,980
   As if you don't
   know the name of
   every boy in town.

145
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,566
        I'm not entirely sure
        what you're suggesting.

146
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,869
   I'm entirely sure
   you're entirely sure
   what I'm suggesting.

147
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,288
            Do you trust him?

148
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,476
    Oddly enough, I do.

149
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,362
               Good.

150
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,887
         The map you asked for.

151
00:12:57,561 --> 00:13:00,111
            There must be
            20 miles of tunnels
            beneath the city.

152
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,829
                Closer to 50.

153
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:05,466
             The Targaryens
             built this city to
             withstand a siege

154
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:09,270
           and to provide
           escape if necessary.

155
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,372
   I'm not escaping.

156
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:13,241
 Strange as it sounds,
 I'm the captain of the ship,

157
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:15,175
 and if the ship goes down,
 I go with her.

158
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:16,911
          That is good to hear.

159
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:22,567
    Though I'm sure many
    captains say the same
    while their ship is afloat.

160
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,069
           You look well suited
           for battle, my lord.

161
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,071
     Well, I'm not.

162
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,507
          For all our sakes,
          I hope you are wrong.

163
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,527
        My little birds tell me

164
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:34,728
         that Stannis Baratheon
         has taken up

165
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:37,198
           with a red priestess
           from Asshai.

166
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:38,799
            What of it?

167
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:42,220
       You don't believe in
       the old powers, my lord?

168
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,389
    Blood spells,
    curses, shape-shifting.
    What do you think?

169
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:50,144
            I think you believe
            in what you see

170
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,546
           and in what those
           you trust have seen.

171
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:57,468
             You probably don't
             entirely trust me.

172
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,069
 Mmm, don't take it personally.

173
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,671
 I don't entirely trust myself.

174
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:03,541
     And yet I have seen things

175
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,377
              and heard things,

176
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,931
       things you have not,
       things I wish I had not.

177
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:16,487
             I don't believe
             I've ever told you
             how I was cut.

178
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,091
 No, I don't believe you have.

179
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,911
             One day, I will.

180

          The dark arts have
          provided Lord Stannis
          with his armies

181
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:33,370
             and paved his path
             to our door.

182
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,525
     For a man in
     service to such powers
     to sit on the Iron Throne,

183
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:39,827
               I can think of
               nothing worse.

184
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:42,430
                And tonight,

 No, I watched my brother
 chopping wood.

 Of course we are.

 Always been a great romantic,

 JOFFREY: Sansa, come here.

220
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,781
          I will pray for your
          safe return, my lord.

00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,686

             for the king's.

 Stay safe, my lady.

 My new blade.

228

229
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,846
        Kiss it.

230
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,624
 You'll kiss it again
 when I return

231
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,509
 and taste my uncle's blood.

232
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,812
    Will you slay him yourself?

233
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,065
 If Stannis is fool
 enough to come near me.

234
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:51,869
      So you'll be
      outside the gates
      fighting in the vanguard?

           liked my head,

          have mutinied.

        She's always

        She hates me.

284
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:54,285
            Maybe she hates you
            less than she hates
            everyone else.

             Sansa.

289

           Yes.

293

   and you will bleed in here.

 just died, you see.

 return my mother to me.

         They are your guests
         under your protection.
         You asked them here.

00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:22,909
 It was expected of me,

397
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:27,231
 as it will be of you
 if you ever
 become Joffrey's queen.

 should somehow prevail,

 these hens will
 return to their cocks

400
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:37,907
 and crow of how
 my courage inspired them,

401
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,892
 lifted their spirits.

402
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,795

                should fall?

403
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,732
   You'd like that,
   wouldn't you?

404
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,968
 The Red Keep
 should hold for a time,

405
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,271
 long enough for me
 to go to the walls

406
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,074
 and yield to Lord Stannis
 in person.

407
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:56,409
 If it were anyone else
 outside those gates,

408
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,394
 I might have hoped
 for a private audience,

409
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,364
 but this is Stannis Baratheon.

410
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,868

 No, you wouldn't,
 would you?

417

 If the city falls,
 these fine women

 CERSEI: When we were young,
 Jaime and I,

464
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:26,563
 we looked so much alike
 even our father
 couldn't tell us apart.

465
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:30,934
 I could never understand why
 they treated us differently.

466
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:35,171
     Jaime was taught to
     fight with sword
     and lance and mace,

467
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,807
          and I was
          taught to smile

468
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,943
            and sing
            and please.

469
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,779
          He was heir
          to Casterly Rock,

470
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,382
       and I was sold to some
       stranger like a horse

471
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,651
         to be ridden
         whenever he desired.

472
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,820
 You were Robert's queen.

473
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,988
          And you will be
          Joffrey's. Enjoy.

474
00:34:56,477 --> 00:34:58,178
            I don't think
            I know this one.

475
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:05,435
         Pretty.

476
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:14,293
 That's the worst curtsy
 I've ever seen.

477
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,329
 Here, it's not difficult.
 I mastered it
 when I was four.

478

 Straighten your back
 and bend.

479
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:25,137
 Better. You learn fast.

480
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,307
       How long have you been
       in Lady Sansa's service?

481
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,962
 A few weeks, Your Grace.

482
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,566
     When did you leave Lorath?

483
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:40,537
               I had a Lorathi
               handmaiden once.

484
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:46,359
         But she was
         a nobleman's daughter.

                 You're not.

486
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,449
              When did you come
              to Westeros?

487
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,370
 Ten years ago, Your Grace.

488
00:35:57,438 --> 00:36:01,775
          From Lorathi commoner
          to the Red Keep
          in 10 years,

489

 are burning, maybe more.

          But...

 But his troops
 have landed
 outside the city walls.

              Where is Joffrey?

 On the battlements
 with Lord Tyrion.

                Bring him back
                inside at once.

                      What?

692
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:44,673
      Like stags.

693
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:47,276
           Stags aren't evil.

694
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:49,512
         They only eat grass.

695
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,645
 And wolves.

696
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,614
             My lord.

697
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,950
 CERSEI: He could hear them
 howling in the night.

698
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:57,085
 The little cub
 was frightened.

699
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:01,406
 His mother said,
 "You are a lion, my son.
 You mustn't be afraid.

700
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,839
 "For one day, all
 the beasts will bow to you.

701
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,575
 "You will be king.

702
00:51:21,696 --> 00:51:25,714
 "All the stags will bow.
 All the wolves will bow.

703
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:29,051
 "The bears in the north
 and the foxes of the south,

704
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:34,089
 "all the birds in the sky
 and the beasts in the sea,

705
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:38,877
 "they will all come
 to you, little lion,

706
00:51:39,913 --> 00:51:41,246
 "to rest a crown
 upon your head."

707
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:49,154
 And the cub said,

708
00:51:49,223 --> 00:51:52,174
 "Will I be strong and
 fierce like my father?"

709
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:56,178
 "Yes," said his mother.

710
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:59,181
     "You will be strong
     and fierce just
     like your father."

711
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:21,520
 I will keep you safe,
 my love.

712
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:23,522
    I promise you.

713
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:26,575
           (DOOR OPENS)

714
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,516
 Back to the boats!

715
00:52:36,703 --> 00:52:38,370
          Stand and fight!

716
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,474
          Stand and fight,
          damn you!

717
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:44,776
       No!

718
00:52:47,815 --> 00:52:49,214
          Father.

719
00:52:54,521 --> 00:52:57,522
   The battle is over.
   We have won.
