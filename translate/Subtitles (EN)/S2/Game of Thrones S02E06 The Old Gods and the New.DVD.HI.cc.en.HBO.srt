                You can't trust

                So you think.

162
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,630
          Wild creatures
          have their own rules,

00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,355
              Now the wildlings

 you couldn't know

169
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,783
             They find a nice
             cave to hide in
             while the sun's up

170
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,518
           and do their killing
           when it's dark.

171

                 This look like

182
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:22,163
           You start thinking

                   We've always
                   been at war.

            not going anywhere.

00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:43,518
              You only have
              one thing to give
              in return,

191
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,420
                     your life.

00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:48,756
 I'll gladly give my life.
           I don't want you
           to be glad about it.

193
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:52,993

          and fight until your
          heart's done pumping.

             Your death will be
             a gift for them
             south of the Wall.

           They won't even
           know your damn name.

00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:08,042

             alive because some
             nameless bastard

200
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:10,645
      north of the Wall
      gave his life for theirs.

 After the Lannisters and
 the Starks, the Tyrells
 command the largest host.

 are the most fertile
 in the Seven Kingdoms,

 for any of

 He blames Stannis
 for Renly's death.

00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,641
           Against my grandson.

271
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,859
           They did.

272
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:21,512
    And perhaps that treason
    should be punished

273
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,214
 one day,

274
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,517
    after Stannis and
    Robb Stark are defeated.

275
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:31,088
    More wine for Lord Baelish.

 an advantageous agreement...

278
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:45,887
        The Tyrell host has
        returned to Highgarden?

 On your son
 Tyrion's directive,

289
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,813
 I met with Catelyn Stark.

290
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:15,282
              Why?

291
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:19,119
 He had an interesting
 proposal for her
 concerning her daughters.

292

                    A wildling.

298
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,593
 We could question her.

299
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,862
                     You could.

300
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,730
              She won't answer.

301
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,933
         I've known a wildling
         to bite off his tongue
         instead of talking.

             Ygritte.

303
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,057
 She was reaching
 for this ax when
 you got to her.

304
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,626
 Give her half a chance,
 she'll bury it in your face.

305
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,863
            I gave you my name.

           I'm Jon Snow.

     Tell me, Ygritte.

310
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,519
           Why do you want us
           to build a big fire?

311
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:01,021
 Are there some more
 friends in the area?

312
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,575
           Burn them
           or maybe you'll need
           those swords again.

313
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,843

 already killed

 would they take me prisoner?

00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:25,892
             You ask for ships.

544
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,196
              You say I shall
              be repaid triple.

545
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:32,349
    I do not doubt your honesty
    or your intentions.

546
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:34,150
              But before you
              repay your debts,

547
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:37,037
            you must seize
            the Seven Kingdoms.

548
00:32:37,106 --> 00:32:38,971
           Do you have an army?
        Not yet.

549
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,973
       You do not have an army.

550
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,342
           Do you have powerful
           allies in Westeros?

551
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:45,278
 There are many there
 that support my claim.

552
00:32:45,347 --> 00:32:46,429
      When were you there last?

553
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:50,016
 I left when I was a baby.

554
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:52,368
            So, in truth,
            you have no allies.

555
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:56,823
 The people will rise
 to fight for their rightful
 queen when I return.

556
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:57,907
                   Ah.

557
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,393
   Forgive me, little princess,

558
00:33:00,462 --> 00:33:04,264
    but I cannot
    make an investment
    based on wishes and dreams.

559
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:05,532
       Now if you'll pardon me.

560
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:08,518
 Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
 Magister of Pentos?

561
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,921
                Yes, we've met.
                A shrewd man.

562
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,340
 For my wedding, he gave me
 three petrified dragon eggs.

563
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,229
 He believed... The world
 believed that the ages
 had turned them to stone.

564
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,698
 How many centuries
 has it been since dragons
 roamed the skies?

565
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,535
 But I dreamt that if
 I carried those eggs

566
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,388
 into a great fire,
 they would hatch.

567
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:32,742
 When I stepped into
 the fire, my own people
 thought I was mad.

568
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:35,145
 But when the fire burned out,

569
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:37,080
      I was unhurt,

570
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:39,383
 the Mother of Dragons.

571
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,170
       Do you understand?

572
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:49,493
 I'm no ordinary woman.

573
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,478
 My dreams come true.

574
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,586
 I admire your passion.

575
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,441
 But in business, I trust
 in logic, not passion.

576
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,026
 I'm sorry, little princess.

577
00:34:07,095 --> 00:34:09,195
               I am not your
               little princess.

578
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:12,349
   I am Daenerys Stormborn
   of the blood of Old Valyria,

579
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,217
  and I will take what is mine.

580
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,686
      With fire and blood,
      I will take it.

581
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:20,406
         Yes, my lady,
         but not with my ships.

582
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:41,711
 Who taught you to read?

583
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,663
            My father, my lord.

584
00:34:43,732 --> 00:34:44,731
    Hmm.

585
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:48,134
 I taught my son Jaime to read.

586
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:55,208
 The maester
 came to me one day,
 told me he wasn't learning.

587
00:34:55,276 --> 00:34:57,911
 He couldn't make
 sense of the letters.

588
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,914
 He reversed them in his head.

589
00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:03,984
    The maester said
    he'd heard tell
    of this affliction

590
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:06,218
 and that we simply
 must accept it.

591
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:08,671
     Ha!

592
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:14,311
 After that, I sat Jaime down
 for four hours every
 day until he learned.

593
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:18,331
 He hated me for it,
 for a time.

594
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:21,434
   For a long time.

595
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,004
    But he learned.

596
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:26,122
        Hmm.

597
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:31,628
 Where is your father?
 Is he alive?

598
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,900
       Who was he?

599
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,785
             A stonemason.

600
00:35:39,854 --> 00:35:41,555
 A stonemason who could read?

601
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:42,656
 Hmm.

602
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:43,840
          He taught himself.

603
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:46,492
       Quite a man.

604
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,396
     What killed him?

605
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,149
                  Loyalty.

606
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,253
 You're a sharp
 little thing, aren't you?

607
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,125
                   Did...

608
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,846
     Forgive me, my lord.
     I shouldn't ask questions.

609
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:09,548
            No.

610
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:12,585
 But you've already begun.

611
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,639
      Did you know your father,
      my lord?

612
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,426
         I did.

613
00:36:21,196 --> 00:36:23,046
 I grew up with him.

614
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,417
     I watched him grow old.

615
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:32,839
                   He loved us.

616
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:34,607
             He was a good man,

617
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,278
                but a weak man.

618
00:36:38,347 --> 00:36:41,614
            A weak man who
            nearly destroyed
            our house and name.

619
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:46,385
                    I'm cold.

620
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,804
 I'll fetch more wood
 for the fire, my lord.

621
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,872
                   Mmm.

 Where are you going, girl?

626
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:22,037
           The armory, my lord.

627
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:25,457
         Why?
            Lord Tywin sent me.

628
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,629
 What might this be?

629
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,482
      Lord Tywin gave it to me.

630
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,452
      What for?

631
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,386
         To take to the armory.

632
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:40,055
 Why would he do that?

633
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:44,276
 Let's go and ask him.

634
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:47,614

635

         Now!

641
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:34,244
       A girl cannot tell a man
       when exactly he must
       do a thing.

642

      A man cannot make a thing
      happen before its time.

643
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,197
 But he's going to tell Tywin.
 He's getting away.

644
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:39,281
 It has to be now.

       I'm not sure I'm a lady.

655
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,303
     Westerosi customs are
     still a bit foreign to me.

656
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:52,271
 It's hard to keep
 all the rules straight.

657
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,574
 But if I remember my lessons,

658
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,461
 a woman of noble birth
 is always called a lady.

659
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,214
 Unless she's a queen
 or a princess.

660
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:02,815
 I could find
 someone who knows.

661
00:40:02,884 --> 00:40:05,084
            Why are you so sure
            I'm of noble birth?

662
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,554
 Because it's obvious.

663
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:11,307
  What if I told you my father
  sold lace on the Long Bridge,

664
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:13,793
      and my mother, my brother
      and I lived with him
      above our shop?

665
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,396
 I'd call you a liar.

666
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:20,132
       Not very noble to accuse
       a lady of dishonesty.

667
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:26,306
          I always thought I
          was a brilliant liar.

00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:29,392
 Better at amputations,
 I'm afraid.

                 I'm not a spy.

673
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:47,309
 Of course, a spy
 would deny being a spy.

674
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,748
           You're right.
           You've found me out.

683

685
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,101
     Lady Talisa...

686
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,070
                  Maegyr.
   Maegyr?

687
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,207
 Forgive me, I do not
 know this name.

688
00:41:35,276 --> 00:41:37,777
       An uncommon name here.
       An old name in Volantis.

689
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,313
            Excuse me, my lady.
            Your Grace.

690
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:52,892
               I've missed you.

691
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,262
            Yes, you look
            positively forlorn.

692
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:58,097
 You surprised me, that's all.

693
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:02,268
 I didn't think
 I'd see you today.

694
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:04,537
     I wish that you were
     free to follow your heart.

695
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,005
        I know.

696
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:08,707
             You have inherited
             your father's
             responsibilities.

697
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,744
                I'm afraid they
                come at a cost.

698
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:14,947
               You are promised
               to another.
           I know.

699
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,234
      A debt that must be paid.

700
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:21,437
 I haven't forgotten.

701
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:23,539
      Your Grace. My lady.

702
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:25,641
     News from Winterfell.

703
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,859
         (WIND HOWLING)

704
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:39,889
      Your brothers desert you?

705
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,808
               I can tell you
               which way to go.

706
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:46,079
     We'll stop here.

707
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,980
      Too dark to go
      any farther today.

708
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:50,616
 Here? There's no shelter here.

709
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:52,084
 There's no shelter anywhere.

710
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,737
        There is... if you know
        where to look.

711
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,209
                 The cold could
                 kill us both.

712
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,494
         If you light a fire...
         No fire.

713
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:04,714
               But a fire is...
        No fire.

714
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,402
              Have it your way.

715
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:19,512
 We'll stay warmer
 if we stay close.

716
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,732
 Bet you freeze to
 death before I do.

717
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:26,952
 Bet your life.

718
00:43:52,914 --> 00:43:54,847
              Think they're out
              looking for you?

719
00:43:56,351 --> 00:43:57,400
                           Yes.

720
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,468
    Think they'll find you?

721
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:01,337
              Yes.

722
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:05,524
         You're brave.

723
00:44:07,262 --> 00:44:08,394
            Stupid,

724
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,346
           but brave.

725
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,819
 We start again at first light.
 Get some sleep.

726
00:44:32,987 --> 00:44:34,520
          Stop moving.

727
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,389
            I'm just trying
            to get comfortable.

728
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:39,441
            Stop it!

729
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:54,173
           You're still moving.
            Was I?

730
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,076
   I didn't notice that time.

731
00:45:08,856 --> 00:45:10,556
           This cannot be true.

732
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:14,760
 We've had ravens
 from White Harbor,
 Barrowton and the Dreadfort.

733
00:45:14,828 --> 00:45:16,128
 I'm afraid it is true.

734
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,048
        Why? Why would Theon...

735
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:22,201
 Because the Greyjoys
 are treasonous whores.

736
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:24,153
                   My brothers?
 We've heard nothing of them.

737
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:26,772
            (SIGHS)

738
00:45:26,841 --> 00:45:28,174
 But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

739
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,978
     I told you,
     never trust a Greyjoy!

740
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:38,250
       I must go north at once.

741
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,019
 There's still a war
 to win, Your Grace.

742
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:43,189
 How can I call myself king
 if I can't hold my own castle?

743
00:45:43,257 --> 00:45:46,359
  How can I ask men to
  follow me if I can't...
                You are a king.

744
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:49,295
  And that means you don't have
  to do everything yourself.

745
00:45:49,364 --> 00:45:50,863
  Let me go and talk to Theon.

746
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:52,899
 There will be no talk.
 He will die for this.

747
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,219
 Theon holds the castle
 with a skeleton crew.

748
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,888
              Let me send word
              to my bastard
              at the Dreadfort.

749
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:03,959
     He can raise a few hundred
     men and retake Winterfell
     before the new moon.

750
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:07,212
         We have the Lannisters
         on the run.

751
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:11,617
   If you march all
   the way back north now,
   you'll lose what you gained.

752
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:16,455
        My boy would be honored
        to bring you
        Prince Theon's head.

753
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:20,092
 Tell your son Bran and
 Rickon's safety is paramount.

754
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,628
     And Theon, I want him
     brought to me alive.

755
00:46:24,632 --> 00:46:27,199
    I want to look him in
    the eye and ask him why.

756
00:46:27,268 --> 00:46:30,069
       And then I'll take
       his head myself.

757
00:46:30,137 --> 00:46:31,671
     Why on earth
     would I trust the word

758
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:33,472
       of a lying little
       savage like you?

759
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,990
      I'm no liar.

760
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,477
              All wildlings are
              liars and savages

761
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,679
            with no loyalty to
            anything or anyone.

762
00:46:40,748 --> 00:46:44,016
 I done what I had
 to do to stay alive.

763
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:48,554
 I hate the Starks
 as well as you do.
 Let me serve you, my lord.

764
00:46:48,622 --> 00:46:52,008
   How? And don't tell me
   to put a spear in your hand.

765
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:55,211
 There are other
 ways to serve, my lord.

766
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,512
           I'm a prince now,
           and you'd do well...

767
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,748
 There are other ways
 to serve, my prince.

771
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:13,796
               You know things?

772
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,098
                Like what?

773
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,717
      How to eat dirt? (LAUGHS)

         Savage things.

777
00:47:27,128 --> 00:47:28,461
            Wait outside.

778
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,746
      I always wondered
      what you had under there.

779
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,383
 It comes at a price.

780
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,118
           I'm not killing you.
           That's your price.

781
00:47:53,187 --> 00:47:54,653
 I already had that.

782
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:58,157
         What do you want then,

783
00:47:58,226 --> 00:47:59,825
                other than your
                miserable life?

784
00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:02,894
 What all free people want.

785
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,330
       My freedom.

786
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:11,637
 Well, you shall have it, then.

787
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:16,192
 But only if you serve me well.

788
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,316
                         Ow!
       Shh.

789
00:48:24,385 --> 00:48:25,784
 It's not deep.

790
00:48:25,853 --> 00:48:27,520
            I thought they were
            going to kill me.

791
00:48:27,588 --> 00:48:29,388
 They thought so, too.

792
00:48:29,457 --> 00:48:31,624
      He hated me,
      the man who hit me.

793
00:48:31,692 --> 00:48:34,810
     I saw it in his eyes.
     Hated me.

794
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:39,131
      He never met me before,
      but he wanted to hurt me.

795
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,900
              Of course he did.
   Why? Why would a stranger...

796
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:44,370
 You are everything
 he will never have.

797
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,372
 Your horse eats better
 than his children.

 It doesn't matter now.
 He's dead.

 I would have given
 them bread if I had it.

 I hate the king
 more than any of them.

00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:01,473
       Does he think I will
       whore myself for a boat?

820
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:04,476
 When I came to this city,
 I had nothing.

821
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:06,812
         Truly nothing.

822
00:51:07,614 --> 00:51:09,431
 I slept by the docks.

823
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,434
 And when I could find
 work loading the ships,
 I would eat.

824
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:15,104
 If not, I dreamed of food.

825
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:18,541
 Today, I am
 the richest man
 in Qarth.

826
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:23,028
 Do you think the path
 from poverty to wealth is
 always pure and honorable?

827
00:51:24,364 --> 00:51:26,365
 I have done many things,
 Khaleesi,

828
00:51:26,433 --> 00:51:28,367
 that a righteous
 man would condemn.

829
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,754
 And here I am,
 with no regrets.

830
00:51:45,886 --> 00:51:48,853
                Bar the gates.
                Ring the bells.

831
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,273
       Slowly, Khaleesi.

832
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:52,907
          (BELLS TOLLING)
       (PEOPLE SHOUTING)

833
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,018
   DAENERYS: Where are they?

834
00:52:10,444 --> 00:52:12,244
          Where are my dragons?

835
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,002
      (DRAGONS SCREECHING)
