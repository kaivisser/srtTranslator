 with the High Septon

           I see
           a potential partner.

136
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,141
 I'm afraid of him.

137
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,608
             Oh, you should be.

138
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,879
          He's a dangerous man.

139
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,982
              But everyone has
              their weaknesses.

140
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:44,852
          Your current employer
          hides his very well,

141
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:48,389
                but not as well
                as he thinks.

142
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,213
               You're a virgin,
               I take it?

143
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,381
              Walk.

144
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,235
            Childhood must have
            been awful for you.

145
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,439
             Were you
             a foot taller than
             all the boys?

146
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:07,208
           They laughed at you,
           called you names?

147
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:09,711
          Some boys
          like a challenge.

148
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,913
     One or two must have tried
     to get inside Big Brienne.

149
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,649
 One or two tried.

150
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,301
                      Ah.

151
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,269
          But you fought
          them off.

152
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,271
    But maybe
    you wished
    one of them could

153
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,175
         overpower you,
         fling you down,
         tear off your clothes.

154
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,244
            But none of them
            were strong enough.

155
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,512
             I'm strong enough.

156
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,713
 Not interested.

157
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,698
          Of course you are.
          You'd love to know

158
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,666
             what it feels like
             to be a woman.

159
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,154
   JAIME: Ah.

160
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,257
 "They lay with lions."

161
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,192
 Tavern girls, I'd say.

162
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,162
 Probably served
 my father's soldiers.

163
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,598
 Maybe one of them gave
 up a kiss and a feel.

164
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,268
 That's how they earned this.

165
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,821
 The glorious work
 of the Northern
 freedom fighters.

166
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,956
 Must make you proud
 to serve the Starks.

167
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,326
      I don't serve the Starks.

168
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:00,261
          I serve Lady Catelyn.

169
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,698
 Tell yourself that tonight
 when they swing
 in your dreams.

170
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,619
            What are you doing?

171
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:09,954
          Burying them.

172
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,774
        We shouldn't stay here.
        We should get
        back on the river.

173
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:15,310
         I think these women
         would understand if...

174
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,278
      I don't care
      what you think.

175
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:19,280
  MAN: I didn't leave it here.
  I had me dagger.

176
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:20,548
                 Untie me. Now!

177
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:22,033
      MAN: I gave it to
      you to cut the rope,

178
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,467
    and now I don't
    have me dagger no more.

179
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,104
    So unless it got
    stuck in your arse
    on its way to your cunt,

180
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:29,007
      it stands to reason
      that it's gone. Whoa.

181
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,109
     What's your business here?

182
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,311
 Traveling a prisoner.

183
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,579
                   (LAUGHS)

184
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:38,633
          You're a woman.

185
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:39,701
      A woman!

186
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:41,318
   Well, fuck me!

187
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:43,688
 If you've quite
 finished up...

188
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,772
      (LAUGHING CONTINUES)

189
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,842
 All right,
 we'll be going.

190
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,144
             Whoa. Whoa!

191
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,064
          Who do you fight for?

192
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:55,683
 The Starks.

193
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:58,886
           What did he do?

194
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:02,457
 Apparently eating is
 now a crime. Who knew?

195
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:04,491
 No, stealing is a crime.

196
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,161
        But it's not
        a crime to starve.
        That's justice for you.

197
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,213
    Where are you taking him?
 To Riverrun.

198
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,848
        Why Riverrun?

199
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,684
 Steal from the Tullys,
 it's their dungeons
 you rot in.

200
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:14,836
       Why not kill him?

201
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:15,970
            For stealing a pig?

202
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:18,306
 I don't give the orders.

203
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:19,773
 He must be
 important to someone.

204
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:22,677
     Sending him with you?
     How important could he be?

205
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,330
              All right,
              have it your way,

206
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,582
                   my lady.

207
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,037
 Do I know you?

208
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,471
                  Have you been
                  to Ashemark?

209
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,140
 No.

210
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,742
        Then you don't know me.

211
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,328
              Do you ever go to
              the river market
              at Salt Rock?

212
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,545
         Is it near Ashemark?

213
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,047
 No.

214
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,183
       I've never been there.

215
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:46,867
 What do you think
 of these beauties?

216
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,305
             I hope you gave
             them quick deaths.

217
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:53,374
          Two of them
          we did, yeah.

218
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,744
                          Wait.

219
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:01,682
      I do know you.

220
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:05,119
 That's Jaime Lannister.

221
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:07,288
    I wish someone had told me.
    I wouldn't have had
    to steal that pig.

222
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:09,791
     If this is the Kingslayer,
     I think I'd know about it.

223
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:11,959
     How do you know what
     the Kingslayer looks like?

224
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:13,127
 I was at Whispering Wood.
 I saw him.

225
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:14,228
 (CHUCKLES)

226
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:15,563
    They dragged him
    out of the woods

227
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:17,164
   and threw him
   down before the king.

228
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,383
       He's not the Kingslayer.
       Sorry to disappoint you.

229
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,685
         If he was, I'd only
         be traveling his head.

230
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,754
              I have a question
              for you both.

231
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:26,190
              And I want you
              to answer it
              at the same time.

232
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,459
              I count to three,
              you both answer.

233
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:30,644
        What's his name?

234
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:32,513
            One.

235
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,766
         Two. Three.

236
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,419
                     (GROANS)

237
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,973
         (GRUNTS)

238
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:52,833
              Two quick deaths.

239
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,555
     (STABBING)
      (GROANING)

240
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:13,821
              (PANTING)

241
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,297
          Those were Stark men.

242
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:25,366
 I don't serve the Starks.

243
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:28,369
 I serve Lady Catelyn.

244
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:30,337
 I told you I'd take
 you to King's Landing,

245
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,290
 and that's what
 I'm going to do.

246
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:35,943
            Stay.

247
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,251
                     (GRUNTS)

248
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,998
      Walder Frey is
      a dangerous man to cross.

249
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,033
 I know that.

250
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,302
                And you mean to
                do it anyway?

251
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:07,275
       I love her.

252
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:09,376
              I know that seems
              important to you.

253
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,061
   It is important to me.

254
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:16,817
       Your father didn't
       love me when we married.

255
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:19,120
    He hardly knew me or I him.

256
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:23,841
             Love didn't
             just happen to us.

257
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,811
         We built it
         slowly over the years,

258
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,747
                stone by stone,

259
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,251
          for you, for your
          brothers and sisters,
          for all of us.

260
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,589
           It's not as exciting
           as secret passion
           in the woods,

261
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,025
            but it is stronger.

262
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,794
           It lasts longer.

263
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,298
 And that is what
 would be in store for me

264
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,966
 with one of
 Walder Frey's daughters,

265
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,234
 what you and father had?

266
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,036
              Why not?

267
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,538
   Because she's not beautiful?

268
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,573
          Because she's not

      just to argue because
      you arranged it.

270
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,411
        And you agreed to it.

              will do the same.

274

      If your father lived
      his life for one thing...

275
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,622
 My father is dead.

276
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:14,775
 And the only parent
 I have left

277
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,727
 has no right to
 call anyone reckless.

       (THUNDER RUMBLING)

279
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,600

 my victory in the flames.

      I still see it.

282
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:44,038
               The flames lied.

283
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:47,574
              And I'm no better
              than a savage

        trusting in a fire god.

285
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:55,616
          I fought for your god
          in Blackwater Bay.

286
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:58,986
               I led my men to
               the gates of
               the seventh hell

287
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,840

 Attacked from behind
 by Tywin Lannister
 and the Tyrells.

289
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,911
 If you see so much
 in your flames,
 why didn't you warn me?

290
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,847
       The Lord of Light
       only allows me glimpses.

291
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,249
 You claimed to
 speak for a god.

292
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,501
          Will you quit the war
          just because
          you've lost a battle?

293
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,904
 You talk about war as
 if you understand it.

294
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:18,973
           I've been fighting
           far longer than you.

               We murdered him.

00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,827
           You will betray
           the men serving you.

313
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,897
                You will betray

                once held dear.

338

 be anything else.

 now firmly in the hands

              charge me double.

 I'm here for money?

 A coin of great value.

          Could it buy a horse?

577
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:42,535
 It is not meant for
 the buying of horses.
