 have stopped at imp.

00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:22,292
 Don't you worry
 about my hands.

562
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,362
 The sea is in my blood.

563
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,449
  Your blood will be in the sea
  if I don't watch
  where I'm going.

564
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:32,752
 I have a proposal
 for my father,

565
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,388
 one that will
 make him king again,

566
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:37,089
 and me after him.

567
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:42,728
 You may get to stay
 in a castle tonight
 if you're lucky.

568
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:44,531
    Is that an offer
    from my future king?

569
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,732
 An order from
 your future king.

570
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:52,038
 You can tell
 your grandchildren
 about this night.

571
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:55,408
 I don't imagine it will be
 a story fit for children.

572
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:04,434
 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

573
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:09,439
 THEON: Father.

574
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,509
 BALON: Nine years, is it?

575
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,396
 They took a frightened boy.

576
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:18,164
 What have they given back?

577
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,133
               A man.

578
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:23,236
      Your blood and your heir.

579
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:24,371
 We shall see.

580
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:28,775
   Stark had you
   longer than I did.

581
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:31,578
            Lord Stark is gone.

582
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:35,849
  And how do you
  feel about that?

583
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:41,020
           What's done is done.

584
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:44,140
    I've brought you
    a proposal from Robb Stark.

585
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,708
 Who gave you those clothes?

586
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:51,464
 Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
 to make you his daughter?

587
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:53,666
      If my clothes offend you,
      I will change them.

588
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:54,834
 You will.

589
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,721
 That bauble round your neck,

590
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,942
 did you pay the iron
 price for it, or the gold?

591
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:04,811
 I asked a question.

592
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:07,447
 Did you pull it from the neck
 of a corpse you made

593
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:11,784
 or did you buy it to
 match your fine clothes?

594
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,439
       Iron or gold?

595
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:20,610
                   Gold.

596
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,268
 I'll not have my son
 dressed as a whore.

597
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,757
       My fears have come true,

598
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,109
           the Starks have
           made you theirs.

599
00:36:36,178 --> 00:36:37,727
     My blood is salt and iron.

600
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,262
 Yet the Stark
 boy sends you to me

601
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:42,665
 like a trained raven
 clutching his message.

602
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,567
           The offer he makes
           is one I proposed.

603
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:45,918
 He heeds your counsel?

604
00:36:45,987 --> 00:36:47,286
           I've lived with him,

605
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:48,855
          hunted with him,
          fought at his side.

606
00:36:48,924 --> 00:36:50,457
  He thinks of me as a brother.

607
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:53,292
 No, not here,
 not in my hearing.

608
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:55,662
 You will not name him brother,

609
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,699
 this son of the man
 who put your true
 brothers to the sword.

610
00:36:59,768 --> 00:37:02,602
 Or have you
 forgotten your own blood?

611
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:04,603
              I forget nothing.

612
00:37:04,673 --> 00:37:07,506
        I remember my brothers.

613
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:10,009
          And I remember when
          my father was a king.

614
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:28,478
        I see.

615
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,230
 I destroy Robb Stark's
 enemies for him

616
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:34,634
 and he will make me
 king of the Iron
 Islands once again.

617
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:36,035
 I will lead the attack myself.

618
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:38,505
 Oh, you will?

619
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:41,173
       I'm your son,
       your only living heir.

620
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:43,142
                    Who else?
         (DOOR OPENS)

621
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:47,546
 I told you to wait outside.

622
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,867
 How did you get
 past the guards?

623
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,302
      Anything with a cock
      is easy to fool.

624
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,538
                 My dear.

625
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:01,127
             Yara?

626
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,030
 So good to see you, brother.

627
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:07,617
 This is a homecoming
 I'll tell my
 grandchildren about.

628
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,588
      She can't lead an attack!

629
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:12,755
 BALON: And why not?

630
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:14,791
                You're a woman!

631
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,559
 You're the one in skirts.

632
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,394
 This isn't Winterfell, boy.

633
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,996
 Your sister took over command
 of your eldest brother's ship

634
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,800
    after your new
    father killed him.

635
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,317
 What's dead may never die.

636
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,620
         ...dead may never die.

637
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:31,541
 The only nights she's
 spent off these islands
 have been spent on the sea.

638
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,611
 She's commanded men.

639
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,813
 She's killed men.

640
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,881
          She knows who she is.

641
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,587
   No man gives me a crown.

642
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,256
          I pay the iron price.

643
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,708
          I will take my crown,

644
00:38:49,778 --> 00:38:52,645
      for that is who I am.

645
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:54,780
        That is who we
        have always been.

646
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:02,004
 You won't stand a chance
 against
 the Lannisters on your own.

647
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,741
          Who said anything
          about the Lannisters?

648
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:15,368
 DAVOS: You'll have your gold
 when we take the treasury
 at King's Landing.

649
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,270
 SALLADHOR:
 All these kings
 fighting for the throne,

650
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:20,173
 and this Stannis
 has the smallest army.

651
00:39:20,242 --> 00:39:22,992
 Why would I bet on the man
 with the worst chance?

652
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,495
           Because you're
           a smart gambler.

653
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:28,498
         Stannis has proved
         himself in war twice.

654
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:31,767
         His baby brother
         has never set foot
         on a battlefield.

655
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,603
       Neither has
       the false King Joffrey.

656
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,638
            And yet they both
            have larger armies.

657
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,574
        Stannis has just
        begun the fight.

658
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:41,344
       His bannermen will
       rally to his cause.

659
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,513
 There's no man in
 the Seven Kingdoms

660
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,615
 more honorable
 than Stannis Baratheon

661
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,116
 or more worthy of loyalty.

662
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:48,618
 What is the world coming to

663
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:51,254
 when smugglers must vouch
 for the honor of kings?

664
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:52,488
       Mind your words, pirate.

665
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,656
     Matthos.

666
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,458
        You think I'm insulted?

667
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:58,695
     I am a pirate.
     I'm an excellent pirate.

668
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:00,463
 I don't sail for promises.

669
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,399
 Of course you do.

670
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:05,067
 Every time you leave harbor,
 you're leaving on a promise,

671
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,636
 a promise that
 somewhere on the sea,

672
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:09,021
 somebody's got some gold
 and you can take it from him.

673
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,356
        That's a promise
        that always comes true.

674
00:40:10,424 --> 00:40:12,208
 As is mine.

675
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:14,144
 You're not
 a young man, Salladhor.

676
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:17,647
 And correct me if I'm wrong,
 most pirates don't grow old.

677
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,599
          Only the clever ones.

678
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,768
 You want to spend
 your last few years on the sea

679
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,703
 stealing from
 Pentoshi cheesemongers

680
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:26,605
 and Myrenese silk merchants,
 then go.

681
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,209
 They're out there
 waiting for you.
 That's easy.

682
00:40:30,277 --> 00:40:32,111
 What I'm offering you is hard.

683
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:38,267
 Come with me and plunder
 the greatest city in Westeros.

684
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:40,886
 You'll be
 the richest man in Lys,
 and the most famous.

685
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,872
 They'll be
 singing songs about you

686
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,790
 as long as men
 have voices to sing.

687
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:48,861
         "Salladhor Saan" is
         a good name for songs.

688
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,647
 It is.

689
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:52,398
 One thing, I want the queen.

690
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:53,900
 The queen?

691
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:55,334
         Cersei, I want her.

692
00:40:55,403 --> 00:40:57,904
     I'll sail with your fleet,
     all 30 of my ships.

693
00:40:57,972 --> 00:41:00,172
        And if we don't
        drown at the bottom
        of Blackwater Bay,

694
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:03,475
 I will fuck this blonde queen
 and I'll fuck her well.

695
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,312
      MATTHOS:
      This war isn't about you.

696
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,746
       We're not
       attacking King's Landing

697
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:09,165
                so that you can
                rape the queen.

698
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:12,134
     I'm not going to rape her.
     I'm going to fuck her.

699
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,536
  As if she would just let you.

700
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:16,089
           You don't know
           how persuasive I am.

701
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:17,907
  I've never tried to fuck you.

702
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,879
   Stannis is the rightful king
   and the Lord of Light,

703
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:24,430
            the one true god...

704
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:25,965
 I've been all over the world,
 my boy,

705
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:29,035
     and everywhere I go,
     people tell me
     about the true gods.

706
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:31,337
 They all think they
 found the right one.

707
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,157
        The one true god
        is what's
        between a woman's legs,

708
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,725
 and better yet,
 a queen's legs.

709
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,530
     I never thought you'd have
     a true believer for a son.

710
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,847
   He's young yet.

711
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:46,135
 I promise you the gold.
 I promise you the glory.

712
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,686
 I cannot
 promise you the queen.

713
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,676
 You believe your king can win?

714
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,761
 He is the one true king.

715
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,629
              You Westerosi
              are funny people.

716
00:41:57,698 --> 00:42:00,566
 A man chops off your fingers
 and you fall in love with him.

717
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,070
            I'll sail with you,
            Davos Seaworth.

718
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:07,873
    You're the most
    honest smuggler I ever met.

719
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,027
                 Make me rich.

720
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:14,229
 Get me to the gates
 of King's Landing and I will.

721
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:27,927
         MATTHOS: When will
         the king have us sail?

722
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:30,062
             As soon as his god
             wills it.

723
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,765
 He's my god, too, and yours,

724
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:35,234
 but you are too blind to see.

725
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:38,571
 Let me teach you how to read.

726
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,872
     Oh, you and your mother.

727
00:42:39,941 --> 00:42:41,441
 It won't take long.
 You already know the letters.

728
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:43,543
 The holy books are
 much more
 persuasive than I can be.

729
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:45,378
     I wish I had a god, truly.

730
00:42:45,447 --> 00:42:48,214
         I'm not mocking you,
         but I've seen men pray
         to every god there is,

731
00:42:48,282 --> 00:42:50,583
                 pray for wind,
                 pray for rain,
                 pray for home.

732
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:51,984
              None of it works.

733
00:42:52,053 --> 00:42:53,352
 But you always came home.

734
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:54,970
              I wasn't praying.

735
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,740
     But I was.

736
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,443
 Every night that
 you were at sea,

737
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,345
 I lit a candle and
 I prayed for you.

738
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:06,315
     You want me to have a god?

739
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:09,485
        Fine.
        King Stannis is my god.

740
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:11,971
 He raised me up
 and blessed me with his trust.

741
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,707
   He gave you a future
   I could never have imagined.

742
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:16,675
    You know how to read.
    You'll be a knight someday.

743
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:19,979
           You think a fire god
           commanded all that?

744
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:23,799
                It was Stannis,
                only Stannis.

745
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:26,386
 Stannis is my king,
 but he's only a man.

746
00:43:26,454 --> 00:43:31,040
  Don't tell him that. (LAUGHS)

747
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,242
       CERSEI: Lord Janos Slynt
       was commander of
       the City Watch.

748
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:34,744
               You had no right
               to exile him.

749
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:36,362
 I have every right.
 I am the King's Hand.

750
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:39,165
         You're serving
         as the King's Hand
         till Father gets here.

751
00:43:39,234 --> 00:43:40,566
             I am Queen Regent.

752
00:43:40,635 --> 00:43:42,268
    Listen to me, Queen Regent.

753
00:43:42,337 --> 00:43:43,802
      You're losing the people.

754
00:43:44,672 --> 00:43:45,738
          Do you hear me?

755
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:47,106
 (LAUGHS) The people.

756
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:48,841
 You think I care?

757
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:53,262
 You might find it difficult
 to rule over
 millions who want you dead.

758
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:55,381
 Half the city will
 starve when winter comes.

759
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:57,500
 The other half will
 plot to overthrow you.

760
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:01,671
 And your gold-plated thugs
 just gave them
 their rallying cry,

761
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,956
 "The Queen slaughters babies."

762
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:09,178
 You don't even have
 the decency to deny it.

763
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:21,908
        It wasn't you who
        gave the order, was it?

764
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:24,543
 Joffrey didn't even tell you.

765
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:29,014
              Did he tell you?

766
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,117
           I imagine that
           would be even worse.

767
00:44:31,186 --> 00:44:33,686
 He did what needed to be done.

768
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,522
          You want to be
          Hand of the King?
          You want to rule?

769
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,975
 This is what ruling is,
 lying on a bed of weeds,

770
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,878
  ripping them out by the root,
  one by one,

771
00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:43,646
    before they
    strangle you in your sleep.

772
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:46,148
 I'm no king,
 but I think there's
 more to ruling than that.

773
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:48,167
   I don't care what you think!

774
00:44:48,236 --> 00:44:49,602
            You've never
            taken it seriously.

775
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,370
     You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

776
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:57,042
         It's all fallen on me.

777
00:45:01,715 --> 00:45:05,151
 As has Jaime, repeatedly,
 according to
 Stannis Baratheon.

778
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:12,124
                 You're funny.

779
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:18,981
    You've always been funny...

780
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,334
      but none of your
      jokes will ever match
      the first one, will they?

781
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,772
             You remember?

782
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,208
         Back when you
         ripped my mother open
         on your way out of her

783
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,193
         and she bled to death?

784
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,431
 She was my mother, too.

785
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,932
            Mother gone...

786
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,986
          for the sake of you.

787
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,742
        There's no bigger joke
        in the world than that.

788
00:46:06,581 --> 00:46:08,113
                   (DOOR OPENS)

789
00:46:08,983 --> 00:46:10,449
       Your Grace.

790
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,950
                 Your Grace.

791
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,052
 STANNIS: How did you
 fare with your pirate?

792
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:17,556
      Salladhor Saan will
      join our fleet, 30 ships.

793
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,558
     His men know how to fight.

794
00:46:19,627 --> 00:46:23,095
 In my experience,
 pirates prefer
 fighting unarmed men.

795
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:24,630
           It does seem
           the wiser choice.

796
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,999
     There won't be
     a choice this time.

797
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:30,169
 Do you trust him?

798
00:46:30,238 --> 00:46:33,672
       Salladhor Saan
       is an old friend.
       I've known him 30 years.

799
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:36,175
        I've never trusted him.

800
00:46:36,244 --> 00:46:40,246
              Now, once he gets
              the smell of gold
              he never stops.

801
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:43,215
 Well, if he does his job,
 he'll have his share.

802
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:48,254
     Leave us.

803
00:46:54,695 --> 00:46:55,744
           At once, Your Grace.

804
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:06,071
        The Lord of Light
        shines through you,
        young warrior.

805
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:08,807
         (WHISPERING)

806
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:12,962
                       Come.

807
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:21,804
       What did you say to him?

808
00:47:21,873 --> 00:47:24,806
 I told him death by fire
 is the purest death.

809
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:26,809
           Why?

810
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:27,877
 Because it is true.

811
00:47:29,831 --> 00:47:31,247
 You're troubled, my king.

812
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:33,532
                    Yeah.

813
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,252
 These armies are toys
 for the Lord of Light.

814
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:39,188
         Tell your lord to
         burn them, then.

815
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:40,723
 I tell him nothing.

816
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,792
           I pray for his
           commands and I obey.

817
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,632
 My little brother
 has 100,000 men,
 according to the scouts,

818
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:52,568
 men whose allegiance
 rightly belongs to me.

819
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:54,704
           You must have faith.

820
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:55,938
       Faith?

821
00:47:57,592 --> 00:48:00,259
 In a real war, the side with
 the greater number wins,

822
00:48:00,328 --> 00:48:02,395
 nine times out of ten.

823
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,280
      Then we must be the 10th.

824
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:08,350
 I cannot defeat my
 brother in the field.

825
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:11,820
 And I can't
 take King's Landing
 without the men he's stolen.

826
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,959
        I have seen the path to
        victory in the flames.

827
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:21,863
         But first,
         you must give yourself
         to the Lord of Light.

828
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:24,666
 I've said the words, damn you.

829
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,572
 I burned the idols.

830
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:37,379
 You must give all of yourself.

831
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:43,752
            I have a wife.

832
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:47,289
                  I took a vow.

833
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:52,494
 She's sickly, weak...

834
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:56,431
 Shut away in a tower.

835
00:48:57,769 --> 00:48:59,769
 She disgusts you.

836
00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:06,125
 And she's given you nothing,

837
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,779
 no sons, only stillborns,

838
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:12,581
     only death.

839
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,058
 (WHISPERING) I will
 give you a son, my king.

840
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,096
                 A son?
