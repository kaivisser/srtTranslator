 MAN 1: Riders approaching!

2
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:07,792
     MAN 2: Open the gate!

3
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,755
      YARA: Why, it's
      the Prince of Winterfell.

4
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,022
         (MEN LAUGHING)

5
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,425
    Envy isn't attractive.

6
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,227
                     What envy?

7
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,762
 You should be proud
 of your brother's achievement.

8
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,332
     I took the great
     castle of Winterfell
     with 20 men.

9
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,234
     You're a great warrior.

10
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,836
       I saw the bodies
       above your gates.

11
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,038
     Which one gave you
     the tougher fight,

12
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,174
     the cripple or
     the six-year-old?

13
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,026
         (MEN LAUGHING)

14
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,861
     I treated
     the Stark boys with honor,

15
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,680
             and they repaid
             me with treachery.

16
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:04,949
 You treated them with honor?
 By butchering them?

17
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,035
     Before I had to kill them,
     I treated them...

18
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,153
 You seized their home,
 as is your right.

19
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,955
 We're ironborn,
 we take what we need.

20
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,557
                 Exactly.

21
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,227
 Then you made them
 prisoners in their home
 and they ran away.

22
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,445
 Is that treachery?

23
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:19,464
 I'd call it bravery.

24
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,199
      They made me a promise...

25
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,868
 Your little boy
 prisoners made you a promise

26
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,604
 and you got mad
 when they broke it?

27
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,255
 Are you
 the dumbest cunt alive?

28
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:29,241
               Don't call me...
     A cunt.

29
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:33,478
 A dumb cunt who killed
 the only two Starks
 in Winterfell.

30
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,480
 You know how valuable
 those boys were?

31
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,383
       If I hadn't killed them,
       the Northerners
       would think me weak.

32
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,253
 You are weak.
 And you're stupid.

33
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,320
               I'm warning you.

34
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,674
 Go on, then. Warn me.

35
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,348
            You haven't
            brought enough men.

36
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,650
           How am I supposed to
           defend Winterfell
           with just this lot?

37
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,034
 You're not.

38
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,888
 I've come to bring you home.
 Father wants a word.

39
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:01,673
    Is this a joke?

40
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,107
 Winterfell is
 the heart of the North.

41
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:07,011
         Aye, it is, hundreds
         of miles from the sea.

42
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,098
 We're islanders, baby brother.
 Had you forgotten that?

43
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,001
                Our power comes
                from our ships.

44
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,803
           And now that you've
           decorated your walls

45
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:16,554
             with the bodies
             of the Stark boys,

46
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,824
       every man in the North
       wants to see you hanged.

47
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,094
   When Robb Stark finds out...

48
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,345
   He won't find out.

49
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:24,979
 We've killed all the ravens.

50
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:26,981
 We have all the horses.

51
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,268
 I've taken Winterfell.

52
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,572
 And I will keep Winterfell.

53
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,926
             Leave us.

54
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:53,742
 Theon, you're my blood.

55
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,579
 We both loved our mother.

56
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:00,381
 We both endured our father.

57
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:04,853
 Come home with me.
 Don't die here alone.

58
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:06,855
         I don't intend to die.

59
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:14,412
 You were a terrible baby,
 do you know that?

60
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,067
 Bawling all the time,
 never sleeping.

61
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,087
 And one night,
 you just wouldn't shut up,

62
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,357
 screaming like a dying pig.

63
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,745
 I walked over to your crib,
 I looked down at you.

64
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:34,048
 I wanted to strangle you.

65
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:37,452
 And you looked up at me
 and you stopped screaming.

66
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:40,321
      You smiled at me.

67
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,129
 Don't die so far from the sea.

68
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,347
    I've brought you a present,
    Lord of Bones.

69
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,684
    I already got one crow.
    Don't need two.

70
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,970
             Mance will want to
             question this one.

71
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,472
     Knows all about
     where the crows are
     and what they're planning.

72
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,243
 The Halfhand knows more.
 This one is just a little boy.

73
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:19,544
           Gut him.

74
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,313
 He could have killed
 me half a dozen times.

75
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,665
 And now he wishes he did.

76
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,683
          Gut him.

77
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,853
  He's a bastard of Winterfell,
  Ned Stark's son.

78
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,176
           Mance will want him.

79
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:37,712
 What does Mance want
 with a dead man's bastard?

80
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,580
                  I don't know.

81
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,249
         I think he'll want
         to decide for himself.

82
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:52,327
 He runs,
 I'll chop his balls off.

83
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:54,762
    He runs, I'll do it meself.

84
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,772
 We're even now, Jon Snow.

85
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,232
            (BREATHING HEAVILY)

86
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,438
              I couldn't do it.

87
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,106
   I had the sword on her neck,
   I just couldn't...

88
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,375
     I know.

89
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,744
                 The others?

90
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,613
 When you didn't come back,
 we went looking for you.

91
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,183
 We found your tracks
 fast enough.

92
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,919
           But they found us
           before we found you.

93
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,254
 They died because of me.

94
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,724
     See that it
     wasn't for nothing.

95
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,259
 MAN: All right, up, lad.

96
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,227
 Come on, on your feet, now.

97
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,563
                       Move it.

98
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,504
       Is she beautiful?

99
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,941
 I've never met her.

100
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,442
           What's her name?

101
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,578
 Frey, I suppose.
 I don't know her first name.

102
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,415
 I'm sure you'll
 be very happy.

103
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,085
        (LAUGHING)

104
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,887
 And you're
 marrying her for a bridge?

105
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,689
       An important bridge.
          Ah.

106
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,761
           It was before they
           killed my father.

107
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,397
        I still thought
        I could march south
        and rescue him in time,

108
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,899
          but only if I crossed
          that bridge.

109
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,671
 When I speak to
 people from the North,

110
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,973
 they all loved your father.

111
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,544
            He was the best man
            I ever met.

112
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,280
    I know children
    always think that
    about their fathers, but...

113
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,382
 Children do not
 always think that

114
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,035
 about their fathers,
 believe me.

115
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,973
          He once told me
          that being a lord is
          like being a father,

116
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,308
          except you have
          thousands of children

117
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:49,610
        and you worry
        about all of them.

118
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,613
 The farmers plowing the fields
 are yours to protect.

119
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:55,783
          The charwomen
          scrubbing the floors,
          yours to protect.

120
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:59,637
          The soldiers you
          order into battle.

121
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,207
       He told me he woke
       with fear in the morning

122
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,709
        and went to bed
        with fear in the night.

123
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,746
          I didn't believe him.

124
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:14,469
         I asked him,
         "How can a man be
         brave if he's afraid?"

125
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:18,272
         "That is the only time
         a man can be brave,"
         he told me.

126
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,428
 I wish I could have met him.

127
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,464
       He would have liked you.

128
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,536
 Most lords worry
 more about their gold
 and their glory

129
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,371
 than the charwomen
 scrubbing their floors.

130
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,874
           He didn't care much
           about gold or glory.

131
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,291
   And you?

132
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:38,626
          You think
          I'm fighting this war

133
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:40,595
                so they'll sing
                songs about me?

134
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,349
             I want to go home.

135
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,651
       I want the men
       following me to go home.

136
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,686
   Then why don't you?

137
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,790
   Because we'll never
   be safe until
   the Lannisters are defeated.

138
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,958
          And because
          I believe in justice.

139
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,060
 Chopping off
 Joffrey's head, you mean.

140
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,528
         That would be a start.

141
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,596
        (HORSE NEIGHING)

142
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:09,774
            Your Grace, milady.

143
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,677
       The Kingslayer,
       he escaped in the night.

144
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:13,744
                     How?

145
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,432
                      How?

146
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:23,837
 Tell me this isn't true.

147
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:29,944
         Why?

148
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:33,247
                 For the girls.

149
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,515
 You betrayed me.
                    Robb...

150
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:36,217
            No!

151
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:40,354
 You knew I would not allow it
 and you did it anyway.

152
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:44,141
        Bran and Rickon are
        captives in Winterfell.

153
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,278
    Sansa and Arya are
    captives in King's Landing.

154
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,948
  I have five children,
  and only one of them is free.

155
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,902
   I lost one son
   fighting by your son's side.

156
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,239
        I lost another
        to the Kingslayer,
        strangled with a chain.

157
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:03,094
        You commit treason
        because your
        children are prisoners?

158
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,781
    I would carve out my heart
    and offer it to the Father,

159
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:11,302
   if he would let my sons wake
   from their graves and
   step into a prison cell.

160
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,038
        I grieve for your sons,
        my lord.

161
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,105
       I don't want your grief.

162
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,973
           I want my vengeance.

163
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,259
      And you stole it from me.

164
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,781
        Killing Jaime Lannister
        would not buy life
        for your children,

165
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,519
         but returning him
         to King's Landing
         may buy life for mine.

166
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,855
 Jaime Lannister has
 played you for a fool.

167
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,225
 You've weakened our position.

168
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,894
 You've brought
 discord into our camp.

169
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,480
 And you did it all
 behind my back.

170
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:44,185
 Make sure she's
 guarded day and night.

171
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:45,570
                Robb.

172
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,822
 How many men did we send
 in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

173
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,989
     Forty, Your Grace.

174
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:52,110
 Send another 40
 with our fastest horses.

175
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:53,661
                 Robb.

176
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,226
           (GROANS)

177
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:12,514
           JAIME: Damn.

178
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,502
 You're much uglier
 in daylight.

179
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,439
 What's your name?

180
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:25,109
         I'm Jaime Lannister
         of Casterly Rock,
         son of Tywin.

181
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:30,598
 A captive knight has
 a right to know his
 captor's identity.

182
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,233
 Brienne of Tarth.

183
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:34,335
 Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

184
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:37,054
 Crescent moons and starbursts.

185
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,723
                   Lord...

186
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,892
                  Selwyn Tarth.
                  Your father.

187
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:47,064
          Do you have any
          brothers and sisters,
          my lady?

188
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,200
        It's a long way
        to King's Landing.

189
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,269
           Might as well get
           to know one another.

190
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,388
 Have you known many men?

191
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:55,923
      I suppose not.

192
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,392
       Women?

193
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,726
        Horses? Ah.

194
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,931
       I didn't mean to
       give offense, my lady.
       Forgive me.

195
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,567
       Your crimes are past
       forgiveness, Kingslayer.

196
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:08,219
 Why do you hate me so much?
 Have I ever harmed you?

197
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,423
          You've harmed others,
          those you were
          sworn to protect,

198
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,308
            the weak,
            the innocent.

199
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,511
 Has anyone ever told you
 you're as boring
 as you are ugly?

200
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,114
           You will not
           provoke me to anger.

201
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,850
          I already have.
          Look at you.

202
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,418
              You're ready to
              chop my head off.

203
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,404
        Do you think you could?

204
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,206
       Do you think you could
       beat me in a fair fight?

205
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,141
 I've never seen you fight.

206
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,378
 The answer is no.

207
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,945
 There are three men
 in the kingdoms

208
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,481
 who might have
 a chance against me.

209
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,399
 You're not one of them.

210
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:41,569
       All my life men like
       you have sneered at me.

211
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:44,505
      And all my life I've been
      knocking men like
      you into the dust.

212
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,675
 If you're so confident,
 unlock my chains.
 Let's see what happens.

213
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,496
   Do you take me for an idiot?
   In!

214
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,885
      I took you for a fighter,
      a man...

215
00:13:57,954 --> 00:14:00,521
        Pardon. Woman of honor.

216
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:03,457
 Was I wrong?

217
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:05,126
 You're afraid.

218
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:09,997
          Maybe one day we'll
          find out, Kingslayer.

219
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,346
 KEVAN:
 King's Landing will fall

220
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,315
 an hour after
 Stannis lands his force.

221
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,302
 It's not too late for
 King Joffrey and Cersei

222
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,505
 and the court to
 ride west to safety.

223
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,140
     Surrender the Iron Throne?

224
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,427
 Better than seeing
 their heads mounted
 on the city gates.

225
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:41,762
 Stannis will execute them all.

226
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:45,216
     No, a king who runs
     will not be king for long.

227
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:49,437
         He's a Lannister.
         He'll stand and fight.

228
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:53,841
   Stannis,
   two days from the capital
   and the wolf at my doorstep.

229
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,978
 The scouts assure us
 Robb Stark remains
 north of Ashemark.

230
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,748
          Ha! The last time
          the scouts assured us
          of Stark's movement,

231
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,317
       he lured us into a trap.

232
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:06,821
 Which is why my son
 is his prisoner.

233
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:12,310
 Too close to Casterly Rock.

234
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:18,065
 He sent a splinter force
 to recapture Winterfell.

235
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,585
 The Greyjoys have
 done us a great favor.

236
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,872
 Stark won't risk
 marching on Casterly Rock
 until he's at full force.

237
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:27,141
           He's a boy and he's
           never lost a battle.

238
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:31,963
     He'll risk anything
     at any time

239
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,381
 because he doesn't
 know enough to be afraid.

240
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,191
       We'll ride at nightfall.

241
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,494
    I want a full night's march
    before he knows
    we're on the move.

242
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:51,281
  Clegane, you'll maintain
  a garrison here at Harrenhal.

243
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,168
    Track down this brotherhood
    and destroy them.

244
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:59,857
     The girl has proven
     herself a good servant.

245
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,193
     She'll stay on with you.

246
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:05,079
        See that he doesn't get
        drunk in the evenings.

247
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:09,467
   He's poor company
   when he's sober,
   but he's better at his work.

248
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:19,260
 GUARD: You've got some
 questions to answer.

249
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,229
 Who killed Ser Amory?

250
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:22,530
 MAN: I don't know! Please!

251
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,797
 GUARD: Give me the name.

252
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,833
 GUARD: Take this
 one out for the crows.

253
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,835
 MAN: I told you, I don't know.

254
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,838
 Please.

255
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,574
   Look,
   it's Yoren's little cunt.

256
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:36,443
     Used to be a boy,
     now it's a girl.

257
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,078
      Where's Jaqen?

258
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,330
       Don't care.

259
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,766
        Where's your stick now,
        bitch?

260
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,452
              I promised to
              fuck you with it.

261
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,154
 GUARD: Come on,
 time to kill some wolves.

262
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,749
 You need sour cherries
 to make it right.

263
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:00,334
 And the secret is
 you dry the stones,

264
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:02,102
 and then you break
 them with a mallet.

265
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:05,238
 That's where
 the real flavor is.
 You crush 'em up real fine.

266
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:07,475
 And then when you're finished,
 you sprinkle them
 over the piecrust.

267
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:08,593
              Where's Jaqen?

268
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:10,428
 How would I know?
              I need him now.

269
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:12,897
 Lord Tywin's marching tonight.

270
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,665
      You need him?

271
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:15,966
               He's helping me.

272
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,068
            HOT PIE: I saw him.

273
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,119
                  Where?

274
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,090
 Where? Where?
                  Ow!

275
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,392
               They went riding
               out the gates
               a few hours ago.

276
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,027
                     On patrol.

277
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,829
             Let go of my ears.

278
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,164
 (HORSE NEIGHING)

279
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,569
               What do you want
               with him anyway?

280
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,320
 QHORIN: Mance is
 gonna march on the Wall.

281
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,539
 When he does,
 one brother inside his army

282
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,674
 will be worth 1,000
 fighting against it.

283
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,776
        They'll never trust me.

284
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,077
 They might.

285
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,712
 If you do what
 needs to be done.
                          What?

286
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,415
 (SHOUTING) How does it feel
 knowing those men all died

287
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,584
 so you could skip
 through the snow
 with your little savage girl?

288
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,287
         I didn't.
 I should have known better,

289
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,355
 trusting a traitor's bastard.

290
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:18,412
 He's not yours to kill, crow.

291
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:42,670
 Do you have to do that here?

292
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,741
 I like to keep me hands clean.

293
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,311
 Yes, but do you
 have to do it here?

294
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:00,987
 You should start
 wearing the gold cloak.

295
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,523
             I don't want to
             wear a gold cloak.

296
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:04,675
 You're commander
 of the City Watch.

297
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,511
 You shouldn't be
 dressed like a common...

298
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,279
              A cloak slows you
              down in a fight.

299
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,548
               Makes it hard
               to move quietly.

300
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,450
             And the gold
             catches the light,

301
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,318
         so you're nice and
         easy to spot at night.

302
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:17,605
 Well, you're not
 sneaking through
 alleyways any longer.

303
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:19,556
 You're supposed to stand out.

304
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,093
       We had a deal
       and wearing a gold cloak
       wasn't part of it.

305
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,777
 Fine, fine.

306
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,414
   No gold cloak.

307
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:36,724
    What?

308
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,024
                    What?
 What? What?

309
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,459
 Why are you staring at me?

310
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,380
         You don't want me
         cleaning me nails.

311
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,964
        You don't want me
        looking your way.

312
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,150
                 Why am I here?

313
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,419
 To help me plan
 the defense of King's Landing.

314
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,503
                (LAUGHS)

315
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:50,671
 Stannis will be here any day.

316
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,772
                      (SIGHS)

317
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,111
      And one of these
      explains how to beat him?

318
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:01,682
 "An History of
 the Great Sieges of Westeros."

319
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,051
 By Archmaester Shevelathin.

320
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,637
   Shevelatesh.

321
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,205
                  Chevalteesh.

322
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,578
        I'd swap all your books
        for a few good archers.

323
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,680
 My Lord Hand.
 Commander.

324
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:20,167
 I must compliment you
 on the gold cloaks'
 performance

325
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:22,219
 these last few weeks.

326
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:25,723
 Did you know there has been
 a marked drop in thievery?

327
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,193
                I did not know.

328
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:32,680
  And how did you accomplish
  this marked drop in thievery?

329
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:34,948
 Me and the lads rounded up
 all the known thieves.

330
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:37,951
               For questioning?

331
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:40,488
                            No.

332
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:42,706
  It's just the unknown thieves
  we need to worry about now.

333
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,241
          We talked about this.

334
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,743
       Aye, we talked about it.

335
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,912
         Have you ever been
         in a city under siege?

336
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,498
  Maybe this part's
  not in your books.

337
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:55,035
     See, it's not the fighting
     that kills most people.
     It's the starving.

338
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:57,204
   Food's worth more than gold.

339
00:20:57,272 --> 00:21:00,991
        Noble ladies
        sell their diamonds
        for a sack of potatoes.

340
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,045
        Things get bad enough,
        the poor start
        eating each other.

341
00:21:05,114 --> 00:21:07,514
 The thieves,
 they love a siege.

342
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,534
  Soon as the gates are sealed,
  they steal all the food.

343
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:15,072
     By the time it's all over,
     they're the richest men
     in town.

344
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,508
 Given the circumstances,
 my lord,

345
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,877
 I believe extreme
 measures are warranted.

346
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,446
      Ah.

347
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,316
 "The Great Sieges
 of Westeros."

348
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,451
 Thrilling subject.

349
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,656
 Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan
 wasn't a better writer.

350
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,396
  Stannis knows King's Landing.

351
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,832
     He knows where
     the walls are strongest,

352
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,169
          and he knows which
          gates are weakest.

353
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,773
      The Mud Gate.

354
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,244
 A good ram will
 batter it down in minutes,

355
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,546
 and it's only 50 yards
 from the water.

356
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:57,397
 That's where he'll land.

357
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:00,201
 And if Stannis does
 attack the Mud Gate,

358
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:02,036
 what is our plan?

359
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,772
             We could throw
             books at his men.

360
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,239
 We don't have that many books.

361
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:07,741
            We don't have that
            many men, either.

362
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,927
     What do we have?

363
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,864
       Pig shit.

364
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:32,432
          (BREATHING HEAVILY)

365
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,868
         I'm not cut out for
         this sort of work.

366
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,472
 I always imagined meself
 doing something much worse.

367
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,275
     We're digging latrine pits
     at the end of the world.

368
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:43,310
           I can't imagine
           anything much worse.

369
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,229
 You lack imagination.

370
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,684
        Where do you think
        Jon is right now?

371
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:53,921
 He went off with the Halfhand.
 He didn't come back.

372
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,606
        A betting man
        would go with dead.

373
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,759
              He's not dead.

374
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:01,311
     No, Jon's a great fighter.

375
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,098
     Well, he's better than me
     and a lot better than you.

376
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,301
        He's got
        a Valyrian steel sword.

377
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,020
         So did his father.

378
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,556
  And Qhorin Halfhand
  is the greatest ranger alive.

379
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,459
 Great rangers never
 get old is the problem.

380
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:18,162
 Shit ones neither.

381
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:21,298
 It's them in the middle

         Look.

 If you find something
 you're not supposed to,

389
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:13,066
 best thing to do
 is pretend
 you've never seen it.

390
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:15,185
  That's a Night's Watch cloak.

391
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,920
 It's been here a long time.

392
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,710
                   Oh.

393
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:25,295
        Must be dragonglass.

             The maesters
             call it obsidian.

396
00:24:31,653 --> 00:24:33,537
 Why would
 a brother hide it here?

397
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:36,874
 I expect it's 'cause
 he wanted somebody to find it.

398
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,448
       Mind where you're going.

             I'm sorry. I'll...

00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:57,661
                Where were you?

401
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,095
 A man has patrol duty.

402
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,899
             Tywin Lannister
             was right here,
             and now he's gone.

403
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:03,934
 A girl owes one more name.

404
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,003
 The Red God demands it.
 Give the man a name.

405
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,706
            How long after
            I give you the name

406
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,591
             does it take you
             to kill someone?

407
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,494
 A minute, an hour, a month.

408
00:25:16,232 --> 00:25:17,614
             Death is certain,

409
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,383
         the time is not.

410
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,720
 He's taking his army
 to attack my brother.

411
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,389
 I need him dead right now.

412
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,258
          This a man cannot do.

413
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,244
 You promised you'd help me.

414
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:33,914
         Help was not promised,
         lovely girl.
         Only death.

415
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:37,500
         There must be others.
         Give a name, any name.

416
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,369
 And you'll kill them?

417
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,438
     Anybody?

418
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:47,561
          By the Seven New Gods
          and the Old Gods
          beyond counting,

419
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,196
                  I swear it.

420
00:25:52,268 --> 00:25:53,600
      All right.

421
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,957
      Jaqen H'ghar.

422
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,833
             A girl gives a man
             his own name?

423
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,035
      That's right.

424
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,236
           Gods are not mocked.

425
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,537
       This is no joking thing.

426
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:14,754
 I'm not joking.

427
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,289
 A man can go kill himself.

428
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:17,775
               Un-name me.

429
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,226
     No.
               Please?

430
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:22,996
 I'll un-name you.

431
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:25,816
                Thank you.

432
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:26,866
 If you help me and
 my friends escape.

433
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,788
            This would require
            more than one life.

434
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,389
               This is not part
               of our bargain.

435
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,907
 Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

436
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:35,892
           A girl lacks honor.

437
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:47,053
            If I do this thing,
            a girl must obey.

438
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:48,855
   A girl will obey.

439
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,845
         A girl and her friends
         will walk through
         the gate at midnight.

440
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:00,901
            Thank you, Podrick.

441
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,793
 Odd little boy.

442
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,678
 I have a certain sympathy
 for odd little boys.

443
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:14,147
 You and Varys both.

444
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:18,318
         Excellent lamprey pie.

445
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,989
        Were you slaving away
        in the kitchen all day?

446
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,374
 I hear Joffrey
 plans on fighting.

447
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,209
 An inspiration for the troops.

448
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,044
              The young king in
              his shining armor

449
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,681
 fighting to defend the capital
 against the wicked old rebel.

450
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,616
 He's only a boy.

451
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:35,402
          Younger boys are
          off fighting his war.

452
00:27:36,005 --> 00:27:37,271
 He's not ready.

453
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:38,555
               What is he, 17?

454
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:40,657
          Remember Jaime at 17?

455
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,459
 Better than you.

456
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:45,061
 Some men have a gift
 for this sort of thing,

457
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,964
      some don't.

458
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,848
 His place is not
 on the battlefield.

459
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,984
        It's not on the throne,
        either,

460
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:52,836
           sadly for all of us.

461
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,158
 Do you think I'm an idiot?

462
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,510
    No, I'd say you possess
    above-average intelligence.

463
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,996
       You shipped off
       my only daughter.

464
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:06,116
 And now you want to
 send my eldest son
 to the battlefield to die.

465
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:08,535
      He'll have his Kingsguard
      protecting him.

466
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,505
           He has the finest
           armor gold can buy.

467
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:13,206
      He needs to be out there.

468
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,074
            The men will
            fight more fiercely

469
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:16,877
           seeing their king
           fighting beside them

470
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,479
    instead of hiding
    behind his mother's skirts.

471
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,632
                   Any dessert?

472
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,502
    Do you know why Varys
    is so dangerous?

473
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:28,872
             Because he has
             thousands of spies
             in his employ.

474
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,775
               Because he knows
               everything we do
               before we do it.

475
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,193
    Because he doesn't
    have a cock.

476
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,528
              Neither do you.

477
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,699
 Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

478
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:44,121
 You, on the other hand,
 are as big a fool
 as every other man.

479
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,724
 That little worm
 between your legs
 does half your thinking.

480
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,459
          It's not that little.
 (LAUGHS)

481
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,268
           Why are you smiling?

482
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,137
 Because I'm happy.

483
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,871
         And why are you happy?

484
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,544
 Because I have
 your little whore.

485
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,566
             I thought you
             preferred blondes.

486
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:15,402
 Such a droll little fellow.

487
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:17,237
 Tell me, have you
 married this one yet?

488
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,690
 No?

489
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,142
 Good.
 Father will be so pleased.

490
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,244
    Why do you care who I fuck?

491
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:26,914
 Because a Lannister
 always pays her debts.

492
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:28,682
 You stole my only daughter,

493
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:30,367
 you plot to have
 Joffrey killed.

494
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,220
  This is madness.
  Stannis will be here in days.

495
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:34,587
                  You need me.
 For what?

496
00:29:34,656 --> 00:29:36,489
 Your skill in battle?

497
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,543
 Pretty thing, your whore.

498
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,413
   Lovely body.

499
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,732
 The bruises will heal in time.

500
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:49,002
        Where did you find her?

501
00:29:49,071 --> 00:29:51,637
 Varys isn't the only
 one who hears whispers.

502
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:55,242
 Really,
 a Lannister lion necklace?

503
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,944
 You need to hide
 your secret whores
 more carefully.

504
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,914
  You've forgotten the most
  important thing about whores.

505
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:02,882
 Oh?

506
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,485
 Well, you're the expert.
 Tell me.

507
00:30:06,688 --> 00:30:08,571
            You don't buy them,

508
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,274
            you only rent them.

509
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:14,277
  You're usually
  a better liar,
  baby brother.

510
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,780
 This one you like.

511
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,716
 You like her very much.

512
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:21,968
 Could it be love?

513
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:25,905
 Don't worry, she'll be
 treated gently enough.

514
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:27,474
 Unless Joffrey is hurt.

515
00:30:27,543 --> 00:30:31,227
 And then every
 wound he suffers,
 she'll suffer, too.

516
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,730
       And if he dies,

517
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,666
  there isn't a man alive
  who could devise

518
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,201
 a more painful death
 for your little cunt.

519
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,158
            And how do I know
            you haven't
            killed her already?

520
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:46,460
 Would you like to see her?

521
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,178
 I thought you might.

522
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:51,131
 Ser Mandon,
 bring in my brother's whore.

523
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,654
         (DOOR OPENING)

524
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:25,532
 I'm sorry they hurt you.

525
00:31:26,935 --> 00:31:28,752
 You must be brave.

526
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,459
 I promise I will free you.

527
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:39,746
             Don't forget me.

528
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,648
           Never.

529
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:51,041
 (DOOR OPENING)

530
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,427
 (DOOR CLOSING)

531
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,718
      I will hurt you for this.

532
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:06,423
         A day will come
         when you think
         you're safe and happy,

533
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:09,993
        and your joy will turn
        to ashes in your mouth.

534
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,096
              And you will know
              the debt is paid.

535
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,032
          Get out.

536
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,129
               Shae!

537
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:34,801
 I've been waiting all night.

538
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,136
       What is wrong?

539
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,138
            You're beautiful.

540
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,381
 Then why do you look sad?

541
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,089
    We have to be more careful.

542
00:32:57,158 --> 00:33:00,660
 Don't be afraid.
 I can take care of myself.

543
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,730
           There are people
           who want to hurt me.

544
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:06,082
 I know. I won't let them.

545
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,551
 I'll cut off their faces.
 I will.

546
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,725
          I would kill for you.
          Do you know that?

547
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,496
          I expect I'll have to
          before this is over.

548
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,734
           You're mine.

549
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,038
       I'm yours.

550
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,673
               Promise me.

551
00:33:34,396 --> 00:33:36,662
 I'm yours, and you are mine.

552
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:51,060
 ROBB: Still no word?

553
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,264
     We've sent a dozen ravens.
     None have returned.

554
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,202
    My bastard is only
    a few days from Winterfell.

555
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,269
 Once he captures the castle...

556
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,337
  Theon has my brothers.

557
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,638
 If we storm the castle...

558
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,507
            He wouldn't
            dare hurt the boys.

559
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:10,280
       They're his only hope
       of escaping
       the North with his head.

560
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,633
 Send word to your son.

561
00:34:15,003 --> 00:34:17,270
 Any ironborn who
 surrender will be allowed

562
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:20,206
 to return safely
 to their homes.

563
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:23,176
  A touch of mercy is a virtue,
  Your Grace.
  Too much...

564
00:34:23,245 --> 00:34:26,913
 Any ironborn
 with the exception
 of Theon Greyjoy.

565
00:34:28,016 --> 00:34:30,399
 He betrayed our cause.

566
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,836
 He betrayed me.

567
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,739
 And we will hunt him down
 no matter where he runs.

568
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,340
        I expect his countrymen
        will turn on him

569
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,909
           the minute
           they hear the offer.

570
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,814
      Your pardon, my lord.
      Your Grace.

571
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:46,266
     My lady.

572
00:34:58,446 --> 00:34:59,946
               How are you?

573
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,182
         How am I?

574
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:05,451
 I've had to arrest my mother.

575
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,587
      The Lannisters
      have my sisters.

576
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:10,373
   The man I considered
   my closest friend

577
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,675
 has seized my home
 and my brothers.

578
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,144
 I'm fighting a war
 and I don't know

579
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,545
 if I should
 march south or north.

580
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,915
             I'm sorry. It was
             a stupid question.
             I'm sorry.

581
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,383
             No.

582
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,418
        Forgive me.

583
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:23,703
          You're being kind.

584
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:25,404
 I have no right.

585
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:26,906
          You have every right.

586
00:35:26,975 --> 00:35:28,341
               You're a king.

587
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:30,476
 That's not the kind
 of king I want to be.

588
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:33,162
   What kind do you want to be?

589
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,213
 I don't know.

590
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:35,699
     The good kind.

591
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,404
 Most kings grew up as princes.

592
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,774
 They spend their whole lives
 preparing for the crown.

593
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,477
 I was raised to be
 Lord of Winterfell.

594
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,098
          I was raised to be
          a proper little lady,

595
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:57,336
    to play the harp and
    dance the latest steps
    and recite Valyrian poetry.

596
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,738
  I'd like to hear
  you play the harp.

597
00:35:58,807 --> 00:35:59,806
         No. No, you would not.

598
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:00,907
 (CHUCKLES)

599
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:09,248
 How did you go from
 reciting Valyrian poetry

600
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:12,118
 to sawing off men's feet?

601
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:24,330
                 When I was 12,

602
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:27,066
           my mother and father
           went to a wedding.

603
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:30,302
       Weddings in Volantis
       last for days, you know.

604
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:33,906
        And they left me
        with my little brother.

605
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:36,142
           The second afternoon
           they were gone

606
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,045
         was the hottest day in
         the three-year summer.

607
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:43,082
 We couldn't bear to be inside,
 so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

608
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:46,452
 Every child in Volantis
 was in the Rhoyne that day.

609
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:49,956
 The rich, the poor,
 we were all there.

610
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:53,559
 Naked, screaming,
 racing to the little islands.

611
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,896
 Drummers were playing
 for coppers on the east bank.

612
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:02,535
          I was treading water,

613
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:05,504
           talking to a friend,

614
00:37:05,573 --> 00:37:08,708
      when I realized
      I hadn't seen my brother.

615
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,343
             I called his name.

616
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:15,114
            Then I started
            screaming his name.

617
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,484
          And then I saw him...

618
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,487
            floating face down.

619
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:25,992
       My heart just...stopped.

620
00:37:26,061 --> 00:37:27,426
                      I was...

621
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,000
 I dragged him from the water.

622
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,970
 My friend helped me, I think.

623
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:39,005
 I don't even remember.

624
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:43,343
 He was so little.

625
00:37:44,746 --> 00:37:47,446
            Then we pulled him
            onto the riverbank.

626
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:52,418
          And I screamed at him
          and I shook him.

627
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:55,788
               And he was dead.

628
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,975
                    Just dead.

629
00:38:02,898 --> 00:38:04,597
                A man ran over.

630
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:09,602
           He had a fish tattoo
           on his face.

631
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,573
       In Volantis,
       the slaves have tattoos.

632
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:17,243
      So you know what they are
      without having
      to talk to them.

633
00:38:17,312 --> 00:38:20,146
            And this man worked
            on a fishing boat.

634
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,550
               And he pushed me
               out of the way.

635
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:28,354
        You have to understand,
        for a slave to
        push a highborn girl,

636
00:38:28,423 --> 00:38:31,558
      that's death for the man,
      a terrible death.

637
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,312
               But he pushed me
               out of the way,

638
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:40,750
        and he started pressing
        on my brother's chest

639
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,954
     again and again and again,

640
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:48,491
      until my brother spat out

641
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,094
            half of the Rhoyne
            and cried out.

642
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,798
   And the man cradled his head
   and told him to be calm.

643
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,707
 I decided two things that day.

644
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,510
          I would not waste my
          years planning dances

645
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,230
        and masquerades with
        the other noble ladies.

646
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:13,766
        And when I came of age,

647
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:18,171
         I would never live
         in a slave city again.

648
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:25,344
                    (SIGHS)

649
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:26,946
         I'm sorry, Your Grace.

650
00:39:27,015 --> 00:39:30,366
   You told me of your problems
   and I've blathered on.

651
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:33,202
 I don't want to
 marry the Frey girl.

652
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,124
 I don't want you to marry her.

653
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,297
    But you needed that bridge.

654
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:48,968
 I hope it's a very
 beautiful bridge.

655
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,890
     (CHUCKLES)

656
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,001
            (MOANING)

657
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,437
 HOT PIE: The sour cherries
 was all crushed up and ready.

658
00:40:57,505 --> 00:40:58,904
 GENDRY: Shut up.

659
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:01,524
 HOT PIE: Probably in
 the piecrust by now.
 In the oven.

660
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,059
     The nice, warm oven.

661
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,762
   Shut up. What did you bring?

662
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,132
 The cheese could be better.

663
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,699
 I did get some nice sausages.

664
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,302
 What did he want us
 to do about those guards?

665
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:14,903
        He didn't say.

666
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,622
   He just said,
   "Walk through the gates."

667
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,024
 What about the guards?

668
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:19,792
   He didn't say
   anything about the guards.

669
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:21,494
 What, he left that bit out?

670
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,662
 It's a pretty important part,
 don't you think?

671
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,265
       We have to trust him.

672
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:26,432
 Trust him?

673
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:28,067
 You trusted him
 to fight with us

674
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:29,769
 when you set him
 free and he ran.

675
00:41:29,837 --> 00:41:31,905
           I want to go back
           to the kitchens.
                       Shut up.

676
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:34,073
    Stay here if you're afraid.

677
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,444
       HOT PIE: Arry, don't.

678
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,407
    Away!

679
00:42:08,476 --> 00:42:09,742
      Reset!

680
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:21,120
      If the wind holds,
      we'll reach King's
      Landing in a day.

681
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:22,822
                  Will it hold?

682
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,891
 Can't make
 promises for the wind,
 Your Grace.

683

 MAN: Again, pull!

684
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,199
        I admire you,
        Ser Davos.

685
00:42:34,268 --> 00:42:37,503
 I thank you, Your Grace.
 Pleased to hear it.

686
00:42:37,571 --> 00:42:41,573
     Some highborn fools
     call you Onion Knight
     and think they insult you.

687
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,909
      So you take the onion
      for your sigil,

688
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,411
 sew it on your coat,
 fly the onion flag.

689
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,464
       My son wishes me
       to change it.

690
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:51,817
 Three mermen with tridents,
 something like that.

691
00:42:51,886 --> 00:42:55,888
 I understand
 why the older families
 look down at me.

692
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:57,890
                Do you? Why?

693
00:42:57,959 --> 00:42:59,458
 My father was a crabber.

694
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:01,193
                      And?

695
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:05,031
 Well, sons of lords don't
 like to break bread
 with sons of crabbers.

696
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,598
 Our hands stink.

697
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,485
     And where were those lords
     when Storm's End starved?

698
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:11,554
   Many fought bravely
   for your brother.

699
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:14,257
 Many fought for the Mad King.

700
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:18,561
         You defend these men
         who insult you
         behind your back.

701
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,496
 Some are happy to
 do it to my face.

702
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,832
           We were forgotten.

703
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:25,234
         Robert and Ned Stark,
         they were the heroes.

704
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:29,405
            The glorious rebels
            marching from
            battle to battle,

705
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,707
           liberating towns
           from the yoke
           of the Mad King,

706
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,110
       while I held Storm's End
       with 500 men.

707
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:35,377
 No one has forgotten,
 Your Grace.

708
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,595
                No? Robert did.

709
00:43:36,664 --> 00:43:38,264
        He gave Storm's End
        to Renly after the war.

710
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:39,899
            Renly never fought
            a day in his life.

711
00:43:39,968 --> 00:43:41,100
 He was only a boy.

712
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,785
          Then why'd he
          give him Storm's End?

713
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:48,841
      First, we ate the horses.

714
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:52,495
    We weren't riding anywhere,
    not with
    the castle surrounded.

715
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:54,663
         We couldn't feed them,
         so fine, the horses.

716
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:57,983
     Then the cats.
     Never liked cats. So fine.

717
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,785
              I do like dogs.

718
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:04,457
        Good animals.
        Loyal. But we ate them.
        Then the rats.

719
00:44:04,526 --> 00:44:07,626
   The night before
   you slipped through,
   I thought my wife was dying.

720
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:09,929
    She couldn't speak anymore,
    she was so frail.

721
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:13,483
          And then you made it
          through the lines.

722
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:16,852
     Slipped right through
     in your little black
     sailboat with your onions.

723
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:19,688
 And potatoes.
 Some salted beef, I believe.

724
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,025
        Every man in
        Storm's End wanted
        to kiss you that night.

725
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,360
 I was relieved they did not.

726
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,915
            Robert told me to
            hold Storm's End,
            so I held it.

727
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,871
        Then he told me he
        was giving it to Renly,
        so I gave it up.

728
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:37,239
                  Insult or no,
                  I gave it up.

729
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,174
            Because Robert was
            my older brother,
            and he was the king

730
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,727
  and I've always done my duty.

731
00:44:41,796 --> 00:44:45,664
 But now, I'm the rightful king
 by every law of Westeros.

732
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:47,816
             And when I sit
             the Iron Throne,
             you'll be my Hand.

733
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,555
    Your Grace,

734
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:58,193
 I pray I serve you well.

735
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,763
       I expect you'll be
       the first crabber's son
       to wear the badge.

736
00:45:05,887 --> 00:45:07,586
 You're
 the Master of Whisperers.

737
00:45:07,655 --> 00:45:09,288
       You're supposed
       to know everything.

738
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:12,324
           No man can be in all
           rooms at all times.

739
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:15,227
 I have many little
 birds in the North, my lord,

740
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,496
 but I haven't
 heard their songs

741
00:45:17,564 --> 00:45:19,731
 since Theon Greyjoy
 captured Winterfell.

742
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:23,602
     The Stark forces
     are distracted.
     Now is the time to strike.

743
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:25,304
       To strike?

744
00:45:25,372 --> 00:45:29,024
 My dear nephew,
 you do see these men
 preparing the walls for siege?

745
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:32,661
 You do understand
 Stannis Baratheon
 sails this way?

746
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,030
            If my Uncle Stannis
            lands on the shores
            of King's Landing,

747
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,932
    I'll ride out to greet him.

748
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:38,818
 A brave choice, Your Grace.

749
00:45:38,887 --> 00:45:41,854
 I'm sure your men
 will line up behind you.

750
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:44,990
          They say
          Stannis never smiles.

751
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:47,493
      I'll give him a red smile

752
00:45:47,562 --> 00:45:49,278
               from ear to ear.

753
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,285
 Imagine Stannis' terror.

754
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,821
           I am trying.

755
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:01,924
     You're an intelligent man.

756
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:03,659
        I'd like to think
        I'm an intelligent man.

757
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:05,628
    Oh, no one
    disputes that, my lord,

758
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,780
    not even the multitudes
    who despise you.

759
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,533
       I wish we could converse
       as two honest,
       intelligent men.

760
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,150
 I wish we could, too.

761
00:46:14,722 --> 00:46:16,656
              What do you want?

762
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:18,925
                    Tell me.

763
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:22,344
 If we're going to play,
 you'll have to start.

764
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:30,686
        My brother was
        the youngest Kingsguard
        in history.

765
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,757
         My sister became queen
         at the age of 19.

766
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,694
   When I reached manhood,

767
00:46:38,763 --> 00:46:42,698
 my father put me in
 charge of all the drains
 and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

768
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:44,766
             A most
             highborn plumber.

769
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,802
                The water never
                flowed better.

770
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:50,005
      And all the shit
      found its way to the sea.

771
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:52,741
 I never expected to
 have any real power.

772
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,743
 So when my father
 named me acting Hand...

773
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,012
          You're quite good at
          being Hand, you know?

774
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:59,915
    Jon Arryn and Ned Stark
    were good men.

775
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,984
         Honorable men.

776
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:04,887
   But they disdained the game
   and those who played.

777
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:06,055
       You enjoy the game.

778
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,190
                        I do.

779
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:09,875
    Last thing I expected.

780
00:47:09,943 --> 00:47:11,277
 And you play it well.

781
00:47:11,345 --> 00:47:13,479
      I'd like to
      keep playing it.

782
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,134
 If Stannis breaches the gates,
 the game is over.

783
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:24,173
    They say he burns
    his enemies alive
    to honor the Lord of Light.

784
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:26,008
 The Lord of Light
 wants his enemies burned,

785
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:28,711
 the Drowned God
 wants them drowned.

786
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,562
 Why are all the gods
 such vicious cunts?

787
00:47:31,732 --> 00:47:34,900
              Where is the god
              of tits and wine?

788
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:39,605
 In the Summer Isles,
 they worship a fertility
 goddess with 16 teats.

789
00:47:39,674 --> 00:47:42,074
        We should sail there
        immediately.

790
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:47,112
                 This morning,
                 I heard a song

791
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:50,782
         all the way from Qarth
         beyond the Red Waste.

792
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:52,284
      Daenerys Targaryen lives.

793
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,273
  A girl at
  the edge of the world
  is the least of our problems.

794
00:47:57,342 --> 00:47:59,224
 She has three dragons.

795
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:03,328
              But even if what
              they say is true,

796
00:48:03,397 --> 00:48:06,832
          it'll be years before
          they are fully grown.

797
00:48:06,901 --> 00:48:09,602
            And then there will
            be nowhere to hide.

798
00:48:10,671 --> 00:48:12,354
    One game at a time,
    my friend.

799
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:24,916
      JORAH: Careful, Khaleesi.

800
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:27,186
            Xaro owns this city
            and the warlocks

801
00:48:27,254 --> 00:48:29,438
           have a thousand eyes
           watching for you.

802
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,141
           I found one.

803
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,477
           A ship
           with a good captain.

804
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:37,279
              She leaves for
              Astapor tomorrow.

805
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,714
       Astapor?

806
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,416
           We cannot stay here.

807
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:43,235
 They have my dragons.
 A mother does not flee
 without her children.

808
00:48:43,303 --> 00:48:46,188
     They're not your children.

809
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,158
      I know they call you
      the Mother of Dragons
      and I know you love them,

810
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,776
            but you didn't grow
            them in your womb.

811
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,713
    They didn't
    suckle at your breast.
    They are dragons, Khaleesi.

812
00:48:53,781 --> 00:48:55,815
       And if we stay in Qarth,
       we'll die.

813
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:59,535
 You should sail to Astapor.
 I'm sure you'll be safe there.

814
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,939
           You know
           I would die for you.

815
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:07,343
      I will never abandon you.

816
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,411
                   I'm sworn to
                   protect you,
                   to serve.

817
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,547
 Then serve me.

818
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:15,184
 If my dragons are in
 the House of the Undying,
 then take me there.

819
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:17,119
 That's what the warlock wants.

820
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:18,838
        He told you so himself.

821
00:49:18,906 --> 00:49:21,707
    If you enter that place,
    you will never leave again.

822
00:49:21,776 --> 00:49:23,275
           His magic is strong.

823
00:49:23,344 --> 00:49:24,777
 And what of my magic?

824
00:49:24,846 --> 00:49:27,880
 You saw me step into the fire.
 You watched the witch burn.

825
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:31,166
 What did the flames do to me?
 Do you remember?

826
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,938
          Until my last breath,
          I will remember.

827
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:40,742
    After I have
    forgotten my mother's face.

828
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:48,317
 They are my children.

829
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:51,854
 And they are the only
 children I will ever have.

830
00:49:58,129 --> 00:49:59,728
 Take me to them.

831
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:14,576
           We should bury them.

832
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:18,848
         I'd leave 'em up
         a few more days.
         Sends a message.

833
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:21,267
    If they haven't got
    the damn message yet,
    a few more days won't help.

834
00:50:22,403 --> 00:50:23,969
                    As you say.

835
00:50:24,038 --> 00:50:27,206
              But it don't hurt
              to let 'em rot
              a while longer.

836
00:50:27,975 --> 00:50:28,974
                  What's this?

837
00:50:29,043 --> 00:50:31,510
     Gold for the farmer.

838
00:50:31,578 --> 00:50:33,212
       For his trouble.

839
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,231
         His troubles are done.

840
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:38,884
    He's feeding the crops now.

841
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,452
                 His wife, too.

842
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,691
 You want to keep a man silent,
 you silence him.

843
00:51:04,945 --> 00:51:07,946
      OSHA: Got as far
      as the farm and
      then doubled back.

844
00:51:10,384 --> 00:51:13,585
 Walked through the stream
 to throw off the hounds.

845
00:51:15,623 --> 00:51:19,158
         Hoped this would
         be the last place
         they'd think to look.

846
00:51:21,094 --> 00:51:22,794
         LUWIN: You're right

847
00:51:22,863 --> 00:51:24,329
               so far.

848
00:51:25,932 --> 00:51:29,168
 OSHA: Who was that
 out there hung up
 at the gates?

849
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:33,572
         Must have been
         the farmer's boys.

850
00:51:34,808 --> 00:51:37,042
 OSHA: He killed them
 and burned them

851
00:51:38,646 --> 00:51:41,413
 and passed them off
 as the little lords?

852
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:44,483
 LUWIN: They mustn't know.

853
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:48,353
 Bran would blame himself.

854
00:51:48,422 --> 00:51:50,289
 OSHA: They'll
 never hear it from me.

855
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:54,493
 The little lads
 have suffered enough.
