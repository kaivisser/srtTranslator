00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,494
         Ilyn Payne. The Hound.

409
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:36,996
       WOMAN: Please, Polliver.
       Some food.

410
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:39,533
         Just a crust of bread.

411
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,169
                 (WOMAN CRYING)

412
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,238
                   Polliver.

413
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,607
                 The Mountain.

414
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,528
 STANNIS:
 Lady Stark, I had not thought
 to find you in the Stormlands.

415
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:11,498
         I had not thought to
         be here, Lord Stannis.

416
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:13,683
 Can that truly be you?

417
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,685
 Who else might it be?

418
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,705
      When I saw your standard,
      I couldn't be sure.

419
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,740
          Whose banner is that?
             My own.

420
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:23,509
             I suppose if we
             used the same one,

421
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:26,163
            the battle would be
            terribly confusing.

422
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:28,315
      Why is your stag on fire?

423
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:31,518
 The king has
 taken for his sigil

424
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:33,587
 the fiery heart of
 the Lord of Light.

425
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:37,674
         Ah, you must be
         this fire priestess
         we hear so much about.

426
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,577
                  Mmm, brother,

427
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:43,546
         now I understand
         why you found religion
         in your old age.

428
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,981
     Watch yourself, Renly.

429
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,850
                 RENLY: No, no,
                 I'm relieved.

430
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:50,236
        I never really believed
        you were a fanatic.

431
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:53,223
              Charmless, rigid,
              a bore, yes,

432
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,342
           but not a godly man.

433
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:57,844
      You should kneel
      before your brother.

434
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:00,330
    He's the Lord's chosen,

435
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,465
  born amidst salt and smoke.

436
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,268
    Born amidst salt and smoke?

437
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,905
                   Is he a ham?
     STANNIS: That's twice
     I've warned you.

438
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,940
 Listen to yourselves.

439
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,709
 If you were sons of mine,
 I would knock
 your heads together

440
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:16,430
 and lock you in a bedchamber
 until you remembered
 that you were brothers.

441
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:19,616
     It is strange to find you
     beside my brother,
     Lady Stark.

442
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,952
    Your husband was
    a supporter of my claim.

443
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,504
      Lord Eddard's integrity
      cost him his head.

444
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,057
      And you sit
      beside this pretender
      and chastise me.

445
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,842
       We share a common enemy.

446
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,578
       The Iron Throne
       is mine by right.

447
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,714
    All those that
    deny that are my foes.

448
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,352
     The whole realm denies it,
     from Dorne to the Wall.

449
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,188
        Old men deny it
        with their death rattle

450
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,623
    and unborn children deny it
    in their mother's wombs.

451
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,562
               No one wants you
               for their king.

452
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:51,181
          You never wanted
          any friends, brother.

453
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,549
      But a man without friends
      is a man without power.

454
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,287
    For the sake of
    the mother who bore us,

455
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,707
   I will give you this
   one night to reconsider.

456
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,994
   Strike your banners,
   come to me before dawn,

457
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,248
 and I will grant you
 your old seat in the Council.

458
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:11,284
 I'll even name you my heir

459
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,586
  until a son is born to me.

460
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,941
     Otherwise I shall
     destroy you.

461
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,679
      Look across those fields,
      brother.

462
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,583
             Can you see
             all those banners?

463
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,086
 You think a few bolts of cloth
 will make you king?

464
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,471
                     RENLY: No.

465
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,058
           The men holding
           those bolts of cloth
           will make me king.

466
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,592
   We shall see, Renly.

467
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,262
 Come the dawn, we shall see.

468
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:41,497
          Look to your sins,
          Lord Renly.

469
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,617
         The night is dark
         and full of terrors.

470
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,642
    Would you believe
    I loved him once?

471
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,699
 I thought we were welcome.

472
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,201
  If you heard a Dothraki horde
  was approaching your city,

473
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,086
         you might do the same,
         Khaleesi.

474
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:23,823
                      Horde?

475
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,658
         My name is Daenerys...

476
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:45,228
    Daenerys Stormborn of
    the house Targaryen.

477
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,763
          You know me, my lord?

478
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,282
    Only by reputation,
    Khaleesi.

479
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:52,419
   And I'm no lord,
   merely a humble merchant.

480
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,957
    They call you
    the Mother of Dragons.

481
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:59,125
                And what should
                I call you?

482
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:00,393
 Oh, my name is quite long

483
00:33:00,462 --> 00:33:03,263
 and quite impossible
 for foreigners to pronounce.

484
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:06,165
    I am simply
    a trader of spices.

485
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:10,237
 But we are the Thirteen,

486
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:13,673
   charged with the governance
   and protection of Qarth,

487
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,809
   the greatest city
   that ever was or will be.

488
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,765
         The beauty of
         Quarth is legendary...
            Qarth.

489
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,335
                     Qarth.

490
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,438
 Might we see the dragons?

491
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:36,346
               My friend,

492
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,766
     we have traveled very far.

493
00:33:39,835 --> 00:33:42,135
     We have no food, no water.

494
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,688
      Once I see my people fed,
      I would be honored...

495
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,890
      Forgive me,
      Mother of Dragons,

496
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,894
     but no man alive has
     seen a living dragon.

497
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,830
       Some of my more
       skeptical friends

498
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:57,083
       refuse to believe
       your children

499
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:59,369
          even exist.

500
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:02,272
   All we ask is the chance
   to see for ourselves.

501
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,640
               I am not a liar.

502
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,876
  Oh, I don't think you are.

503
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:08,344
     But as I've
     never met you before,

504
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:11,014
   my opinion on the matter
   is of limited value.

505
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,902
             Where I come from,

506
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:20,974
     guests are
     treated with respect,
     not insulted at the gates.

507
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:24,344
 Then perhaps you should
 return to where you come from.

508
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:26,045
       We wish you well.

509
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,884
            What are you doing?

510
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:34,154
    You promised to receive me.

511
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,023
      We have received you.

512
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:39,976
       Here we are,
       and here you are.

513
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,663
       If you do not let us in,
       all of us will die.

514
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:46,533
             Which we shall
             deeply regret.

515
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:49,569
       But Qarth did not become
       the greatest city
       that ever was or will be

516
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:52,905
    by letting Dothraki savages
    through its gates.

517
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,415
 Khaleesi, please be careful.

518
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,318
               Thirteen!

519
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:13,593
     When my dragons are grown,
     we will take back
     what was stolen from me

520
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:15,828
           and destroy those
           who have wronged me.

521
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:21,300
 We will lay waste to armies
 and burn cities to the ground.

522
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,904
           Turn us away and we
           will burn you first.

523
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,790
                Ah.

524
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,193
     You are a true Targaryen.

525
00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:33,263
          Only, as you said
          a moment ago,

526
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,765
          if we don't let
          you into the city,
          you will all die.

527
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,550
              And so...

528
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:40,019
     Retreating in fear
     from a little girl

529
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:42,421
      is unbecoming of
      the greatest city

530
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,123
  that ever was or will be.

531
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:47,661
        The discussion is over,
        Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

532
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,563
      The Thirteen have spoken.

533
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:51,698
 I am one of the Thirteen,

534
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:55,035
 and I am still speaking.

535
00:35:55,103 --> 00:35:57,237
           The girl threatens
           to burn our city
           to the ground

536
00:35:57,305 --> 00:36:00,239
    and you would invite her in
    for a cup of wine?

537
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:02,925
 She is
 the Mother of Dragons.

538
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:08,214
 Do you expect her to
 watch her people starve
 without breathing fire?

539
00:36:08,283 --> 00:36:10,716
 I believe we can
 allow a few Dothraki

540
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:13,353
 through our gates
 without dooming our city.

541
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:16,489
 After all, here I am,

542
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:20,443
  a savage from
  the Summer Isles,
  and Qarth still stands.

543
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,013
         Our decision is final.

544
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,281
   Very well.

545
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:29,852
 I invoke soumai.

546
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:37,310
 I will vouch for her,
 her people,

547
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:39,913
 and her dragons,
 in accordance with the law.

548
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,304
            Be it on your head.

549
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,458
 Welcome to Qarth,
 my lady.

550
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,409
 MOUNTAIN: You.

551
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,671
 TICKLER:
 Is there gold or silver
 in the village?

552
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,390
      I'm not from the village.

553
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,759
 Where is the Brotherhood?

554
00:37:59,828 --> 00:38:00,893
                  I don't know
                  what that is.

555
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,052
              (SQUEAKING)

556
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:16,442
              (HORSES NEIGH)

557
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:34,360
 MAN: You two.
 Take Lord Lannister's
 things to his quarters.

558
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,262
                 What's this?

559
00:38:36,331 --> 00:38:40,133
    We weren't expecting you
    till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

560
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:41,700
      (CHUCKLES) Evidently not.

561
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:45,504
            Why are
            these prisoners not
            in their cells?

562
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,241
 MOUNTAIN: Cells are
 overflowing, my lord.

563
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:52,194
 POLLIVER:
 This lot won't be here long.
 Don't need no permanent place.

564
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:55,548
 After we interrogate 'em,
 we usually just...

565
00:38:55,617 --> 00:38:59,836
  Are we so well-manned
  that we can afford to discard

566
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,004
       able young bodies
       and skilled laborers?

567
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,283
   You, do you have a trade?

568
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,070
 GENDRY: Smith, my lord.

569
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:20,924
       What are you looking at?
       Kneel!

570
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:26,179
           Kneel or I'll carve
           your lungs out, boy.

571
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:28,148
 He'll do no such thing.

572
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,484
        This one's a girl,
        you idiot,

573
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,154
         dressed as a boy.

574
00:39:34,222 --> 00:39:36,455
              Why?
               Safer to travel,
               my lord.

575
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,125
       Smart.

576
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:41,094
             More than I can
             say for this lot.

577
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:43,846
   Get these prisoners to work.

578
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:44,931
             Bring the girl.

579
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:47,683
        I need a new cupbearer.

580
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,118
 MOUNTAIN: My lord.

581
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,503
      (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

582
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,711
         Your visits are
         too few, cousin.

583
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:00,079
              Her Grace,
              the Queen Regent,

584
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,831
        commands you to release
        Grand Maester Pycelle.

585
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,933
           Here's your warrant.

586
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,000
        So it is.

587
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,354
 Will you take a cup with me?

588
00:40:08,422 --> 00:40:11,207
    I find that mulled
    wine helps me sleep.

589
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:15,445
    I am here at
    Her Grace's behest,
    not to drink with you, Imp.

590
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,330
         If my sister was so
         concerned for Pycelle,

591
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:20,416
           I would have thought
           she'd come herself.

592
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:23,619
     Instead she sends you.
     What am I to make of that?

593
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,455
           I don't care
           what you make of it,

594
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:28,190
     so long as you release
     your prisoner immediately.

595
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,394
          And you've received
          these instructions
          directly from Cersei?

596
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,330
     As I said several times.

597
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,917
    And you've waited this long
    to deliver the information?

598
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:40,603
 When the Queen Regent
 gives me a command,
 I carry it out without delay.

599
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:47,326
            Cersei must have
            great trust in you,

600
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:51,030
  allowing you into her chamber
  during the hour of the wolf.

601
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,354
 The Queen Regent has
 a great many responsibilities.

602
00:40:58,406 --> 00:40:59,906
      She often works
      from dusk till dawn.

603
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:04,209
        She must be very glad
        to have you helping her
        from dusk till dawn.

604
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,946
          Ah.

605
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:08,314
       Lavender oil.

606
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,700
  She always loved
  lavender oil, even as a girl.

607
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,902
               I am a knight!

608
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,054
       An anointed knight, yes.

609
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:17,490
                Tell me,
                did Cersei have
                you knighted

610
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,876
         before or after she
         took you into her bed?

611
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:24,146
          What? Nothing to say?

612
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,765
               No more warnings
               for me, ser?

613
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,566
   You will withdraw
   these filthy accusations.

614
00:41:27,635 --> 00:41:29,435
              Have you ever
              given any thought

615
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:31,237
           to what King Joffrey
           will have to say

616
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:34,407
            when he finds out
            you've been bedding
            his mother?

617
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:40,012
       It's not my fault!

618
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,915
             Did she take you
             against your will?

619
00:41:42,984 --> 00:41:44,750
   Can you not defend yourself,
   knight?

620
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:48,154
 Your own father, Lord Tywin,
 when I was named
 the King's squire,

621
00:41:48,223 --> 00:41:50,223
 he told me to obey
 her in everything.

622
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,158
              Did he tell you
              to fuck her, too?

623
00:41:52,227 --> 00:41:55,278
       I only meant I
       did as I was bid.

624
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,046
 Hated every moment of it,

625
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,215
 is that what
 you'll have me believe?

626
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,200
 A high place in court,
 a knighthood,

627
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,503
 my sister's legs spreading
 open for you at night.

628
00:42:03,571 --> 00:42:06,021
 Oh, yes,
 it must have been terrible.

629
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,057
 Wait here. His Grace
 will want to hear this.

630
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,992
      Mercy! Mercy,
      my lord! I beg you.

631
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:12,145
        Save it for Joffrey.
        He loves a good grovel.

632
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:14,613
 My lord, it was
 your sister's bidding,
 the Queen.

633
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:16,382
   I'll leave the city
   at once, I swear.

634
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,967
           No, I think not.

635
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,669
         My lord?

636
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,487
            You heard me.

637
00:42:25,427 --> 00:42:28,661
          My father told you
          to obey my sister.
          Obey her.

638
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:31,397
        Stay close to her side.
        Keep her trust.

639
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,966
         Pleasure her
         whenever she requires.

640
00:42:34,035 --> 00:42:38,521
         No one ever need know,
         as long as you
         keep faith with me.

641
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:43,042
          I want to know
          what Cersei is doing,

642
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:47,714
 where she goes, who she sees,
 what they talk of, everything.

643
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,133
          And you will tell me.

644
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:53,186
 Yes, my lord, I will.

645
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:54,720
 I swear it, as you command.

646
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,893
            Oh, rise, rise.

647
00:43:00,961 --> 00:43:03,679
             Let us drink to
             our understanding.

648
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,799
      Oh, you don't have a cup.
      Oh, well.

649
00:43:06,868 --> 00:43:09,702
 Smile, cousin. My sister
 is a beautiful woman,

650
00:43:09,771 --> 00:43:11,287
 and it's all for
 the good of the realm.

651
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,656
 Go back and tell her
 that I beg her forgiveness,

652
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:15,792
    that I want no more
    conflict between us

653
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,495
    and that, henceforth,
    I shall do nothing
    without her consent.

654
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:21,363
               But her demands?

655
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,167
 Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

656
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:26,185
                 You will?
 Yes, I'll release him
 in the morning.

657
00:43:26,254 --> 00:43:28,020
 Cersei can keep him
 as a pet, if she wants,

658
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:30,089
 but I will not have
 him on the Council.

659
00:43:30,158 --> 00:43:32,725
 I could swear
 that I had not harmed
 a single hair on his head,

660
00:43:32,793 --> 00:43:35,994
 but that would not,
 strictly speaking, be true.

661
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:43,836
        (WOOD CREAKING)

662
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:50,109
 MAN:
 Stay within one table length.

663
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:56,699
                 Your Grace.

664
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,540
 Do your knucklebones
 bring you luck?

665
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,780
         Well, life's been good
         since you hacked
         them off, Your Grace.

666
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,948
          And it's four less
          fingernails to clean.

667
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,950
        Fewer.
                     Pardon?

668
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:18,971
 Four fewer
 fingernails to clean.

669
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,241
 Never understood why
 you had to wear them.

670
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:26,145
            It reminds me of
            where I come from
            and where I am now.

671
00:44:26,214 --> 00:44:27,813
             It reminds me
             of your justice.

672
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:30,549
    It was an honest punishment
    and you were good
    with the cleaver.

673
00:44:30,618 --> 00:44:32,918
 You were a hero
 and a smuggler.

674
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:38,557
     A good act does
     not wash out the bad,
     nor a bad the good.

675
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:42,461
            A lesson I've tried
            to teach my son.

676
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:43,562
 Does he listen?

677
00:44:43,631 --> 00:44:44,630
                  To me?

678
00:44:44,698 --> 00:44:45,965
                  Gods, no.

679
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:50,102
        But if your red woman
        told him to leap
        from the crow's nest...

680
00:44:50,171 --> 00:44:51,703
      She has a name.

681
00:44:55,243 --> 00:44:57,977
 I trust you've not forgotten
 your smuggler's tricks.

682
00:45:00,547 --> 00:45:02,148
              I've lived within
              the law for 17...

683
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:04,450
 I want you to be
 a smuggler this time.

684
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,587
          Any shore, any night.

685
00:45:07,655 --> 00:45:08,988
     What am I bringing ashore?

686
00:45:09,056 --> 00:45:10,556
 The red woman.

687
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:16,295
 No one must know
 what you do and we'll not
 speak of this again.

688
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:20,399
        I am true to Your Grace
        and always will be,

689
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,085
      but surely there are
      other ways, cleaner ways.

690
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:25,487
    Cleaner ways don't
    win wars.

691
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:57,486
          Are you afraid,
          Onion Knight?

692
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:05,627
   Someone once told me
   the night is dark
   and full of terrors.

693
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,563
           You've carried
           more unpleasant
           cargo in your time.

694
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:15,604
            Are you a good man,
            Ser Davos Seaworth?

695
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:19,608
     I'd say my parts
     are mixed, my lady,
     good and bad.

696
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:23,879
           If half an onion
           is black with rot,
           it's a rotten onion.

697
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,282
               A man is good
               or he is evil.

698
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,285
    And which are you?
                  Oh, good.

699
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:34,356
 I'm a knight myself, of sorts,
 a champion of light and life.

700
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:38,160
     Well, that must be
     very nice for you.

701
00:46:54,462 --> 00:46:58,230
         Do you love your wife?
         I do.

702
00:46:58,299 --> 00:47:00,366
             Yet you have
             known other women.

703
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:02,200
 Don't talk about my wife.

704
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,954
           I'm not. I'm talking
           about other women.

705
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,357
            Like me, Ser Davos.

706
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,147
                You want me.

707
00:47:15,215 --> 00:47:17,483
      You want to see
      what's beneath this robe.

708
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,687
                And you will.

709
00:47:26,327 --> 00:47:28,661
 Strange that
 this Lord of Light

710
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:31,029
 asks you to work
 in the shadows.

711
00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:35,701
        Shadows cannot live
        in the dark, Ser Davos.

712
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,506
    They are servants of light,
    the children of fire.

713
00:47:40,574 --> 00:47:43,959
    And the brighter the flame,
    the darker they are.

714
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,545
 These weren't here before.
 They've barred the passage.

715
00:47:48,149 --> 00:47:50,382
                 They can't bar
                 our passage.

716
00:47:55,756 --> 00:47:57,523
          Gods protect us.

717
00:47:57,592 --> 00:48:01,160
          There's only one god,
          Ser Davos,

718
00:48:01,229 --> 00:48:03,562
           and he only protects
           those who serve him.
