 No wonder you're
 all so miserable.

00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:43,477
      Would you please shut up?

           You're a free woman?

 I might be your prisoner,
 but I'm a free woman.

97

         If you're my prisoner,
         you're not

  That's what "prisoner" means.

 And you think you're free?

 and now you can
 never touch a girl.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,133

            to say the words.

 But you chose
 never to touch them.

    if you want to be
    a man of the Night's Watch.

             isn't the problem.

136
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,080
             It's finding them.

137
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,482
 Have you gone soft, Clegane?

138
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,835
 I always thought you
 had a talent for violence.

139
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,954
             Burn the villages,
             burn the farms.

140
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,457
 Let them know what it means
 to choose the wrong side.

141
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,525
    Mmm.

142
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,847
                Is that mutton?

143
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,348
 Yes, my lord.
          (DOOR CLOSING)

144
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,566
             Don't like mutton.

145
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,519
 I'll bring something else.

146
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,754
                      Leave it.

147
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:26,457
           Are you hungry?

148
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,658
 No.

149
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,393
           Of course you are.

150
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,646
                    Eat.

151
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,482
 I'll eat in the kitchen later.

152
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,385
         It's bad manners to
         refuse a lord's offer.

153
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:39,487
                  Sit.

154
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,657
         Eat.

155
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:47,245
 You're small for your age.

156
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,615
 I suppose you've been underfed
 your whole life.

157
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,367
         I eat a lot.

158
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:55,002
         I just don't grow.

159
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,070
          Mmm.

160
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:01,643
 This will be my last war.

161
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:04,845
            Win or lose.

162
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,183
 Have you ever lost before?

163
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,487
       Do you think I'd
       be in my position
       if I had lost a war?

164
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,645
        But this is the one
        I'll be remembered for.

165
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:24,616
         The War of Five Kings,
         they're calling it.

166
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,304
   My legacy will be determined
   in the coming months.

167
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,658
 Do you know what legacy means?

168
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,398
  It's what you pass
  down to your children
  and your children's children.

169
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,786
          It's what remains of
          you when you're gone.

170
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,592
       Harren the Black thought
       this castle
       would be his legacy.

171
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:56,297
           The greatest
           fortress ever built.

172
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:59,867
      The tallest towers,
      the strongest walls.

173
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:02,336
           The Great Hall had
           35 hearths.

174
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,472
            Thirty-five.
            Can you imagine?

175
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,941
             Look at it now.

176
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:10,911
            A blasted ruin.

177
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:14,315
     Do you know what happened?

178
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,016
         Dragons?

179
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,668
                      Yes.

180
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,120
             Dragons happened.

181
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,462
       Harrenhal was
       built to withstand
       an attack from the land.

182
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,201
       A million men could have
       marched on these walls,

183
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,737
      and a million men
      would have been repelled.

184
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:41,209
    But an attack from
    the air with dragon fire...
    Mmm-mmm.

185
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:44,395
        Harren and all his sons
        roasted alive
        within these walls.

186
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,965
             Aegon Targaryen
             changed the rules.

187
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,570
   That's why every child alive
   still knows his name

188
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,805
     300 years after his death.

189
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,724
 Aegon and his sisters.

190
00:12:58,628 --> 00:12:59,794
                    Mmm?

191
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,963
 It wasn't just
 Aegon riding his dragon.

192
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,682
 It was Rhaenys
 and Visenya, too.

193
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,318
                   Correct.

194
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,603
          A student of history,
          are you?

195
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:11,305
 Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

196
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:13,407
 Visenya rode Vhagar.

197
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:18,179
         I'm sure I knew
         that when I was a boy.

198
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:20,881
 Visenya Targaryen
 was a great warrior.

199
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:25,152
 She had a Valyrian steel sword
 she called Dark Sister.

200
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,705
                  Hmm.

201
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,523
      She's a heroine of yours,
      I take it?

202
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:32,877
          Aren't most
          girls more interested

203
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,529
        in the pretty
        maidens from the songs?

204
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:36,830
       Jonquil with
       the flowers in her hair?

205
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,766
 Most girls are idiots.
                       (LAUGHS)

206
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:42,937
  You remind me of my daughter.

207
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:46,874
        Where did you learn
        all this stuff about

208
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,260
          Visenya and her
          Valyrian steel sword?

209
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,429
 From my father.

210
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:57,085
 He was a well-read stonemason.

211
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:01,722
        Can't say I've ever met
        a literate stonemason.

212
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,075
 Have you met many stonemasons,
 my lord?

213
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,163
           Careful now, girl.

214
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:12,533
                I enjoy you,
                but be careful.

215
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,502
                Take that back
                to the kitchen.

216
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:16,470
             Eat what you want.

217
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,409
                     And, girl.

218
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:24,995
                 "M'lord."

219
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,584
    Lowborn girls say "m'lord,"

220
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:32,653
                 not "my lord."

221
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:35,556
     If you're going to
     pose as a commoner,
     you should do it properly.

222
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,647
 My mother served Lady Dustin
 for many years, my lord.

223
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,366
 She taught me how
 to speak proper...
 Properly.

224
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:51,355
      You're too smart
      for your own good.
      Has anyone told you that?

225
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:52,806
        Yes.

226
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:55,175
                     Go on.

227
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,639
 I beg pardon, ser.

228
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:15,012
    I should have
    come to you after
    to thank you for saving me.

229
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,080
             You were so brave.

230
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,149
      Brave?

231
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,319
 A dog doesn't need
 courage to chase off rats.

232
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:24,305
           Does it give you
           joy to scare people?

233
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:26,540
 No, it gives me
 joy to kill people.

234
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:29,043
 Spare me. You can't tell me

235
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:32,229
 Lord Eddard
 Stark of Winterfell
 never killed a man.

236
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,449
             It was his duty.
             He never liked it.

237
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,618
 Is that what he told you?

238
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,852
         He lied.

239
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:41,722
 Killing is
 the sweetest thing there is.

240
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,292
 Why are you always so hateful?

241
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,013
 You'll be glad of
 the hateful things I do
 someday when you're queen

242
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:52,299
 and I'm all that
 stands between you
 and your beloved king.

243
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,694
 I've demanded
 a meeting of the Thirteen.

244
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,396
 One of them did this
 or knows who did.

245
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,098
   You are one of the Thirteen.

246
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,249
 If I wanted your dragons,
 I would have taken them.

247
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:10,851
 They mean nothing
 to me on their own.

248
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,970
             Nothing?

249
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,356
    They're more valuable
    than anything in the world.

250
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:16,657
 Shall we look inside my vault

251
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,276
 and see what
 selling your dragons

252
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,327
 would buy me I
 cannot buy already?

253
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,496
 We will get them back.

254
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,717
         There is no we,
         so why would you
         help me get them back?

255
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,254
 I took you under my protection
 in front of
 the rulers of my city.

256
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,458
 A man is what others
 say he is and no more.

257
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:38,729
 If they say that Xaro
 Xhoan Daxos is a liar,
 my word is worth nothing.

258
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,281
 I cannot let this
 thing happen to you
 under my roof.

259
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,584
              But it did happen
              under your roof.

260
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:47,071
 Khaleesi, many times in
 my life, I have been...

261
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,772
             I don't care
             where you've been.

262
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:16,066
       You think we're savages
       because we don't
       live in stone castles.

263
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,921
        We can't make
        steel as good as yours,
        it's true, but...

264
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:22,523
 We're free.

265
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:25,492
 If someone tried to tell us
 we couldn't lie
 down as man and woman,

266
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:28,196
 we'd shove
 a spear up his arse.

267
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:29,964
 We don't go
 serving some shit king

268
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,033
 who's only king
 because his father was.

269
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,634
                   No.

270
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:36,503
    No, you serve Mance Rayder,
    the King beyond the Wall.

271
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:39,606
 We chose Mance Rayder
 to lead us.

272
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:44,028
 He was a crow, same as you,
 but he wanted to be free.

273
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,566
 You could be free, too.

274
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:52,953
 You don't need to
 live your whole life
 taking commands from old men.

275
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,756
    Wake up when you
    want to wake up.

276
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,876
 I could show you
 the streams to fish,
 the woods to hunt.

277
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:02,280
 Build yourself a cabin
 and find a woman to lie
 with in the night.

278
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,784
 You're a pretty lad.

279
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,587
 The girls would claw
 each other's eyes out
 to get naked with you.

280
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,624
                   Walk.

281
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,479
 I could teach you
 how to do it.

282
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:20,314
         I know how to do it.

283
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,620
 You know nothing, Jon Snow.

284
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:57,084
 And what did she say?

285
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:59,453
       She admired your spirit,
       Your Grace.

286
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:01,372
     And what then?

287
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,641
                   She...

288
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:08,829
 If every man were
 held accountable for the

289
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,399
 actions of every
 distant relative, Ser Alton,

290
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:12,650
      we'd all hang.

291
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,155
           She tore the paper
           in half, Your Grace.

292
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,908
 You've acted with honor.

293
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:22,843
     I thank you for it.

294
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,212
 Lord Karstark,
 see that Ser Alton's

295
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:27,514
 pen is clean,
 and give him a hot supper.

296
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,250
   Ser Alton's pen is occupied,
   Your Grace.

297
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,436
          The prisoners
          from the Yellow Fork.

298
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:34,588
 Too many prisoners.

299
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,808
 Is there room for Ser Alton?

300
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,877
      Does he need to lie down?

301
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,666
     Have the men
     build him a new pen.

302
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:48,252
 Put him in with
 the Kingslayer for now.

303
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,120
 Have your boy watch over them.

304
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,421
                       Torrhen.

305
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,757
      That will be all.

306
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,666
                   Your Grace.

307
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,251
 A minute of your time?

308
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,252
          I've been treating
          your wounded men.

309
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,439
 And my enemies,
 as some of my bannermen
 are fond of mentioning.

310
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:27,224
        They're not my enemies.

311
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,343
 That's what I tell
 my bannermen.

312
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:32,046
           I've already run
           through the supplies
           I brought with me.

313
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:36,266
      Some are easily replaced.
      Egg yolks, turpentine,
      oil of roses.

314
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,019
    But some are not.

315
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:41,121
     I need silk for stitching.

316
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,309
          I need fennel root
          for those with fever,

317
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:48,328
        willow bark. Mostly I
        need milk of the poppy.

318
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:51,765
       You saw what it was like
       to amputate
       a foot without any.

319
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:56,103
       I assume there will
       be more loss of limb
       before this war is over.

320
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,571
 If you need help
 finding these...

321
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:59,022
     I know where to find them.

322
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,626
     I'm sorry,
     I shouldn't interrupt you.

323
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,646
 Continue, my lady.

324
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,386
      You're riding to the Crag
      to negotiate a surrender?

325
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:13,971
         Yes.

326
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,773
  The Crag will have a maester
  and he will have what I need.

327
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,142
 I expect he will.

328
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,312
       If I could write a list.

329
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,213
 Come with me to the Crag.

330
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:26,750
 I don't think that will be...

331
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,703
           Let the maester
           show you his stores.

332
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:32,290
         I want the wounded men
         to be treated well,

333
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,992
           all the wounded men.

334
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,096
         (DOGS BARKING)

335
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,034
 WOMAN:
 Children, come inside, quick.

336
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,569
 CHILD: Come on.

337
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,904
           Hurry up!

338
00:21:49,524 --> 00:21:50,758
 MAN: Can't find anything, ser.

339
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:52,059
        They've lost the scent.

340
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:54,061
       Try again.

341
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,797
       We've circled
       this farmhouse twice.
       There's no sign of them.

342
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:59,699
 We could start
 the search fresh
 in the morning, my lord.

343
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:02,636
        I'm looking at spending
        the rest of my life

344
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:05,840
            being treated like
            a fool and a eunuch
            by my own people.

345
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,543
   Ask yourself, is there
   anything I wouldn't do
   to stop that from happening?

346
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:13,781
  The hounds will
  find the scent again.
  I'll beat them until they do.

347
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,401
       I'll whip every man here
       until I have both
       those boys in hand.

348
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,120
   And once I've got them,
   the pampered little shits...

349
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,625
              It's better to be
              cruel than weak.

350
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:26,910
          Prince Theon.

351
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,646
           Where are they?
        Who, m'lord?

352
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,981
          The Stark boys.
          Where are they?

353
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,632
 I don't know. I seen no one.

354
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:33,700
 (GROANS)

355
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,619
        Think harder.

356
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,389
 I swear, m'lord. I don't know.

357
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,259
 My lord, over here.

358
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,332
 I think I've found
 what we're looking for.

359
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,177
 Send the old man home.

360
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,250
         Go back to Winterfell.

361
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,019
           Take him back.

362
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,607
 Theon, don't do this.

363
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:33,944
              You came back.

364
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,062
 As soon as I heard.

365
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,864
 Do you know anything?

366
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:40,367
              Irri is dead.

367
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:41,718
 I know.

368
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:46,023
 She was a good...
                    She's dead.

369
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,259
          She died alone.
          She died for me and I
          couldn't protect her.

370
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,045
        Doreah?

371
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,197
             We can't find her.

372
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:58,802
         She must be dead, too.

373
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:02,022
   I led my people
   out of the Red Waste
   and into the slaughterhouse.

374
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,007
 I should have been here.

375
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:06,977
    You went to find me a ship.

376
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,980
 My place is by your side.

377
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,215
 I shouldn't
 have left you alone
 with these people.

378
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:14,317
                "These people"?

379
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,303
 They are not to be trusted.

380
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,055
      And who is to be trusted?

381
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,125
             Who are my people?

382
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,993
                The Targaryens?

383
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,862
   I only knew one, my brother,

384
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:26,630
             and he would have
             let a thousand men

385
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,348
             rape me if it had
             got him the crown.

386
00:24:29,252 --> 00:24:31,185
                  The Dothraki?

387
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:32,919
           Most of them
           turned on me the day

388
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:34,587
           that Khal Drogo
           fell from his horse.

389
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:36,523
 Your people are in Westeros.

390
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:39,092
         The people in Westeros
         don't know I'm alive.

391
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,128
 They will soon enough.
                 And then what?

392
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:43,330
    They'll pray for my return?

393
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,650
    They'll wave dragon banners
    and shout my name?

394
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,185
             That's what my
             brother believed
             and he was a fool.

395
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,588
      You are not your brother.

396
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,390
            Trust me, Khaleesi.

397
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,659
 There it is.

398
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:58,662
 "Trust me."

399
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:01,332
 And it's you I
 should trust, Ser Jorah?

400
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,666
    Only you?

401
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:09,306
 I don't need trust any longer.

402
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,876
 I don't want it and I
 don't have room for it.

403
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,394
  You are too young to be so...

404
00:25:14,463 --> 00:25:16,030
 And you are too familiar.

405
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,953
          Forgive me, Khaleesi.

406
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:28,875
          No one can
          survive in this world
          without help. No one.

407
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,812
       Let me help you, please.

 with his huntsmen
 and his hounds.

489

 And when he returned,
 he would present me

 with some pelts
 or a stag's head,

 present him with a baby.

 Not that I wanted
 him there, mind you.

    proposed to keep him out.

00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:23,826
             Shh!

543
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,304
               You were saying?

544
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:35,872
         I...

545
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,976
 Never mind. It's embarrassing.

546
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,212
             More embarrassing
             than being chained

547
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:44,414
              to a post covered
              in your own shit?

548
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:48,651
 I remember
 everything about that day,

549
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,954
 your helmet, your horse,

550
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,823
 the rake lines in
 the dirt along the list,

551
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,725
 where the sun was
 in the sky when

552
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:57,594
 you knocked Balon Swann
 from his horse,

553
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,530
 and the dent in your shield
 when you handed it back to me.

554
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,734
 I'll remember it
 all until I die.

555
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,005
 That was the best day
 of my life.

556
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:16,346
 And I remember
 being on the field
 after it was over.

557
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:19,249
 All the competitors were done.
 I was the last one out there.

558
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,819
 And I couldn't leave.

559
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,689
 I couldn't bring myself
 to go and sit with my family

560
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,525
 at a table so far
 on the edge of the feast

561
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:31,161
 you could barely
 even see the bride.

562
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,895
 And I couldn't
 bear to tell them

563
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,598
 what it had been
 like squiring for you,

564
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,366
 when I knew that
 they could never have

565
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:38,101
 the faintest idea
 what I was talking about.

566
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,605
       I understand completely.

567
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:42,839
 How could you?

568
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:48,411
 Sorry, I...
 I didn't mean to doubt you.
 It's just that I...

569
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,248
               I was 16 once.

570
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:55,084
       I also had to
       replace someone's squire
       on short notice.

571
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:56,253
 Which knight was it?

572
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,288
               Barristan Selmy.

573
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,527
         The fight against
         the Kingswood Outlaws.
         Before your time.

574
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:06,530
 What was he like?

575
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:08,698
                      (SIGHS)

576
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,000
                     He was...

577
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,171
                  A painter.

578
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,475
   A painter who only used red.

579
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:27,984
       I couldn't imagine being
       able to fight like that,
       not back then.

580
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:32,121
       And to help him do that,
       to be a part of
       something that perfect.

581
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,660
         I don't need to
         explain how that felt,
         not to you.

582
00:36:38,347 --> 00:36:39,679
   It's hard to put into words.

583
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,380
                     It's like

584
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,683
          stepping into a dream
          you've been dreaming

585
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:45,952
              for as long as
              you can remember,

586
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:48,188
 and finding out that the dream

587
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,223
 is more real than your life.

588
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:55,428
 Leaving that battlefield was

589
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,631
 like being
 dragged off to prison.

590
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,700
 Did you squire for him again?

591
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:01,935
                        No.

592
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:04,570
       I didn't have your gift.

593
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:09,408
        He couldn't take a step
        without stepping on me.

594
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,344
          I was awful,
          a complete liability.

595
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:17,016
  Until one of
  the outlaws decided

596
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:20,286
 to take on
 a 16-year-old squire.

597
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:27,727
              It's a good thing
              I am who I am.

598
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:31,430
          I'd have been useless
          at anything else.

599
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:39,472
            I'm not well-suited
            for imprisonment.

600
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,474
              Shocking, I know.

601
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:42,842
                  Some men are.

602
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:45,661
                   Ned Stark,

603
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,466
        I imagine he made
        an excellent prisoner
        right up until the end.

604
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,335
                Not me, though.

605
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:55,805
 My life has left me
 uniquely unfit for constraint.

606
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:00,577
 And have you thought about...

607
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,412
          Of course. Every day.

608
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,280
              And?

609
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:10,553
            Good prisoners
            breed good jailers,
            apparently.

610
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,255
   The Starks are very careful.

611
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:16,225
 But there is a way, I think.

612
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:20,296
 It wasn't possible until now.

613
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:22,732
     What is it?

614
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,639
    It's actually quite simple.

615
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,057
 Well, let me help you.

616
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,526
               You'll only have
               to do one thing.

617
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,977
        Tell me.

618
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:40,033
           You'll have to die.

619
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:11,731
          (CHOKING)

620
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:17,921
 (BONE CRACKING)

621
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:35,188
    Jorah the Andal.

622
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:39,692
             This man must sail
             past old Valyria.

623
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,646
          All who travel too
          close to the doom
          must have protection.

624
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,581
     I didn't come
     here for lessons.

625
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,884
  No, you came for the dragons.

626
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,586
    You have them?

627
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,289
 Where are they?

628
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:54,791
             Draw your sword.

629
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:58,444
 See what your steel is worth.

630
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:04,200
         You want to please
         the Mother of Dragons.

631
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:12,191
            You love her.

632
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,714
 Where are the dragons?

633
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,567
     Will you betray her again,
     Jorah the Andal?

634
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,024
     Will you betray her again?

635
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:32,879
          Never.

636
00:40:39,453 --> 00:40:40,904
             The thief you seek

637
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,740
              is with her now.

638
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:51,114
 I did not leave
 the comfort of my home

639
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,765
 to come to yours
 and be called a thief.

640
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,733
 No one is calling you a thief.

641
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,585
 Who is she to accuse us?

642
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,789
 Please, they're my children.
 I'm begging you.

643
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:03,693
 Begging us?
 It wasn't very long ago
 you were threatening us.

644
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:06,162
          Without me,
          the dragons will die.

645
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,280
       It will be for the best.

646
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:10,649
 Your dragons
 will bring the world

647
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,519
 nothing but death
 and misery, my dear.

648
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:15,871
 If I knew where they were,
 I would not tell you.

649
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,541
      PYAT PREE:
      You are cruel, my friend.

650
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,227
          The Mother of Dragons
          is in the right.

651
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:23,629
      She must be
      reunited with her babies.

652
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,149
 I will help you, Khaleesi.

653
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,834
                   How?

654
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:32,871
 I will take you to
 the House of the Undying
 where I have put them.

655
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,692
           You have my dragons?

656
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,111
     When I learned you
     were coming to our city,

657
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,647
      I made an arrangement
      with the King of Qarth.

658
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:42,715
         (LAUGHING)

659
00:41:43,651 --> 00:41:45,418
 He procured them for me.

660
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:47,604
 But there is no King of Qarth.

661
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,056
       There is now.
       That was the other
       half of the arrangement.

662
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:55,978
 You would keep your
 gates and your minds

663
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:58,915
 closed to everything
 outside your walls,

664
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,267
 but Qarth cannot
 remain the greatest city

665
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:03,602
 that ever was if it
 refuses to change.

666
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:08,607
 I will open Qarth to the world
 as I have forced it
 to open itself to me.

667
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,428
 Your ambition is
 an inspiration.

668
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,049
 But like all upstarts,
 you overreach.

669
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:21,604
 Three dragons the size of cats
 and an alliance
 with a charlatan

670
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:23,957
 do not make you a king.

671
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:26,676
 An upstart and a charlatan?

672
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:29,462
 Empires have
 been built by less.

673
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:33,065
 Those on the margins
 often come to
 control the center,

674
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,869
 and those in
 the center make room for them,
 willingly or otherwise.

675
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:44,460
    The Mother of Dragons
    will be with her babies.

676
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,765
 She will give them her love
 and they will
 thrive by her side,

677
00:42:53,855 --> 00:42:54,870
          forever.

00:43:20,548 --> 00:43:23,699
      Where will you run to,
      Daenerys Stormborn?

683
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:27,086
   Your dragons wait for you
   in the House of the Undying.

684
00:43:27,155 --> 00:43:28,654
               Come see them.

685
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,316
            Lady Stark!
    No farther.

686
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,985
 Keep your hands off me, woman.

687
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:45,154
 Don't enter without
 an invitation, man.

688
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:49,208
        Forgive me. Lady Stark.

689
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:50,343
 CATELYN: What is it?

690
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:51,410
    They caught the Kingslayer.

691
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:56,399
         (MEN SHOUTING)

692
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,583
 Kingslayer!

693
00:43:57,651 --> 00:43:58,684
 Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
 Hang him!

694
00:43:58,752 --> 00:43:59,751
 Hang him!

695
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:01,954
         (MEN SHOUTING)

696
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:06,075
 You'll die today.

697
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,944
 Justice for the Karstark.

698
00:44:21,593 --> 00:44:22,642
 Gut him!

699
00:44:35,656 --> 00:44:37,757
       Get back!
       I want his head!

700
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:41,527
     Any man who stands
     between a father

701
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,980
      and his vengeance
      asks for death.

702
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,548
         Lord Karstark,

703
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,767
 this man is our prisoner.

704
00:44:49,537 --> 00:44:51,220
    This monster killed my son.

705
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,306
 And crippled mine.

706
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:57,042
 He will answer for his crimes,
 I promise you, but not here.

707
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,445
  I will have his head.
  And if you try and stop me...

708
00:44:59,514 --> 00:45:00,930
 You will strike me down?

709
00:45:01,882 --> 00:45:04,350
 Have you forgotten me, ser?

710
00:45:04,419 --> 00:45:06,819
 I am the widow of your liege,
 Lord Eddard Stark.

711
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:08,221
 I am the mother of your king!

712
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,455
     And where is our king now?

713
00:45:09,524 --> 00:45:10,823
 You know very well.

714
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,942
 He has gone to the Crag
 to accept the surrender.

715
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:16,695
         Aye, gone to the Crag,
         but not to negotiate.

716
00:45:16,764 --> 00:45:18,580
        He brought that
        foreign bitch with him.

717
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:19,865
 How dare you!

718
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:21,467
          Threatening my lady
          is an act of treason.

719
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,634
    Treason?

720
00:45:22,703 --> 00:45:24,770
 How can it be treason
 to kill Lannisters?

721
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:26,622
 I understand
 your grief, my lord,

722
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,275
 better than most,
 I understand it.

723
00:45:29,343 --> 00:45:32,612
 But in the name of my son,
 the King in the North,

724
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,013
        stand down.

725
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:39,969
         When your son returns,
         I will demand
         this murderer's head.

726
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:42,337
 Wise men do not
 make demands of kings.

727
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,457
            Fathers who
            love their sons do.

728
00:45:45,527 --> 00:45:47,326
          I will have his head.

729
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,982
         Thank you for
         fighting on my behalf,
         Lady Stark.

730
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:55,284
           I would have come to
           your defense, but...

731
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,620
 Take him to the stockades.

732
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,605
 Bind him with every
 chain you can find!

733
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,174
 You've become a real she-wolf
 in your later years.

734
00:46:02,243 --> 00:46:03,809
             There's not much
             fish left in you.

735
00:46:03,878 --> 00:46:05,277
      And gag him!

736
00:46:10,784 --> 00:46:13,319
 Since when do you
 light your own candles?

737
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:15,854
         Since I decided that I
         can't stand to look at

738
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:18,324
         any of my handmaidens
         for another instant.

739
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,629
 How many times
 can you read one raven scroll?

740
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,732
 Stannis Baratheon's
 fleet has been spotted

741
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:29,802
 sailing north past Tarth,
 200 ships.

742
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:31,570
             More than we have.

743
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:34,440
 Yes, that's more than we have.

744
00:46:34,509 --> 00:46:37,994
 He'll be at our
 gates within five days,
 four if he has the wind.

745
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:41,013
    We have strong, high walls.

746
00:46:41,082 --> 00:46:44,383
          We'll rain fire down
          on them from above.

747
00:46:44,452 --> 00:46:46,252
 "Rain fire on them
 from above."

748
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:48,053
 You're quoting Father,
 aren't you?

749
00:46:48,122 --> 00:46:49,522
                   Why not?

750
00:46:49,591 --> 00:46:51,340
         He has a good mind for
         strategy, doesn't he?

751
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,126
 Call it tactics, not strategy.

752
00:46:54,195 --> 00:46:56,495
 But, yes, he does
 have a good mind for it.

753
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,765
 The best mind, some would say.
 Sadly, he's not here.

754
00:47:01,302 --> 00:47:03,852
 It's just you, me and Joffrey,

755
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:07,239
 the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
 and Protector of the Realm.

756
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:10,926
           I'm sure you'll make
           a point eventually.

757
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:14,363
 He needs to start
 acting like a king.

758
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:17,699
 This war you started
 is coming to our doorstep.

759
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,802
 And if the entire city
 wants Joffrey dead...

760
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:23,105
            I'm not the one
            giving the boy
            whores to abuse.

761
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,540
 I thought the girls
 might help him.

762
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,458
               Did you?
 I was wrong.

763
00:47:29,697 --> 00:47:32,197
 If we can't control him...

764
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,632
  Do you think I haven't tried?

765
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,170
       He doesn't listen to me.

766
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,475
 It's hard to put
 a leash on a dog

767
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:45,911
 once you've put
 a crown on its head.

768
00:47:49,817 --> 00:47:52,167
           I always hoped
           he'd be like Jaime.

769
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:55,705
          He looks like him.

770
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:01,477
           In a certain light.

771
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,550
 The boy is more Robert
 than Jaime.

772
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:10,452
   Robert was a drunken fool,
   but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

773
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:15,274
            Sometimes I wonder.

774
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,209
           What?

775
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,629
          If this is the price

776
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,566
           for what we've done,

777
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:25,768
                for our sins.

778
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:27,636
         Sins?

779
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,305
 The Targaryens...

780
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,758
 Wed brother and sister
 for hundreds of years, I know.

781
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:37,162
          That's what
          Jaime and I would say

782
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:38,998
          to each other in
          our moments of doubt.

783
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:42,568
     It's what I told Ned Stark
     when he was stupid
     enough to confront me.

784
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,940
         Half the Targaryens
         went mad, didn't they?

785
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,492
           What's the saying?

786
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,677
         "Every time
         a Targaryen is born,
         the Gods flip a coin."

787
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,281
 You've beaten the odds.

788
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:59,818
 Tommen and Myrcella are good,
 decent children, both of them.

789
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,640
             (SOBS)

790
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,399
 MAN 1: Then why wait?

791
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,650
 MAN 2:
 We're sworn to the king.

792
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:32,901
 There's not a king.

793
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,069
 That's treason.

794
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,138
 MAN 1: So is
 saving Lannisters, yeah?

795
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:39,207
 Back off, you.
      No, I won't.

796
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:41,910
           Your son returns
           at dawn, my lady?

797
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,279
 So they say.

798
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,114
        BRIENNE: The Kingslayer
        won't last the night.

799
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:49,701
       The more they drink,
       the angrier they'll get.

800
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,888
        And when the Karstarks
        draw their swords...

801
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,240
         Who wants to die
         defending a Lannister?

802
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,759
            Come.

803
00:50:04,017 --> 00:50:05,951
 MAN: He'll not be
 making it through the night.

804
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:16,295
 I need to be alone with him.

805
00:50:16,363 --> 00:50:18,246
 My lady, our orders...

806
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,149
 Your orders,
 which I just gave you,

807
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,517
 are to leave me
 alone with him.

808
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:30,810
           Come to say goodbye,
           Lady Stark?

809
00:50:30,878 --> 00:50:33,462
      I believe it's my
      last night in this world.

810
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:36,481
              Is that a woman?

811
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,483
 Do you hear them out there?

812
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,752
 They want your head.

813
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,357
       Old Lord Karstark
       doesn't seem to like me.

814
00:50:45,426 --> 00:50:48,627
 You strangled his son
 with your chains.

815
00:50:48,696 --> 00:50:50,830
                  Oh. Oh.

816
00:50:50,898 --> 00:50:52,330
               Was he the one
               on guard duty?

817
00:50:55,036 --> 00:50:56,868
            He was in my way.

818
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:58,337
          Any knight would
          have done the same.

819
00:50:58,405 --> 00:51:00,839
 You are no knight.

820
00:51:00,908 --> 00:51:03,241
 You have forsaken
 every vow you ever took.

821
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,077
              So many vows.

822
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:08,079
 They make you swear and swear.

823
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:11,483
              Defend the king,
              obey the king,
              obey your father,

824
00:51:11,552 --> 00:51:14,619
          protect the innocent,
          defend the weak.

825
00:51:14,688 --> 00:51:17,539
      But what if your
      father despises the king?

826
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,677
        What if the king
        massacres the innocent?

827
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,513
               It's too much.

828
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:28,283
         No matter what you do,
         you're forsaking
         one vow or another.

829
00:51:28,352 --> 00:51:30,569
 Where did you find this beast?

830
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,739
 She is a truer knight
 than you will ever be,

831
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:37,275
       Kingslayer.

832
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,461
                 Kingslayer.

833
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:42,464
            What a king he was.

834
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:45,784
     Here's to Aerys Targaryen,
     the Second of His Name,

835
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:49,354
    Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
    Protector of the Realm,

836
00:51:49,423 --> 00:51:52,123
          and to the sword
          I shoved in his back.

837
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,628
 You are a man without honor.

838
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,100
                 Do you know,

839
00:52:01,168 --> 00:52:04,253
          I've never been with
          any woman but Cersei.

840
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:05,955
              So in my own way,

841
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:08,657
         I have more honor than

842
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:12,161
             poor old dead Ned.

843
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:16,231
      What was the name of
      that bastard he fathered?

844
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,299
     Brienne.

845
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:18,400
            No, that wasn't it.

846
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,138
      Snow,
      a bastard from the North.

847
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:29,260
 Now, when... When good old Ned
 came home with
 some whore's baby,

848
00:52:30,297 --> 00:52:31,997
    did you pretend to love it?

849
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,433
                           No.

850
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:37,636
            You're not very
            good at pretending.

851
00:52:37,705 --> 00:52:39,622
        You're an honest woman.

852
00:52:40,507 --> 00:52:42,808
            You hated that boy,
            didn't you?

853
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:45,927
    How could you not hate him?

854
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:48,547
               The walking,
               talking reminder

855
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:52,318
             that the honorable
             Lord Eddard Stark

856
00:52:52,386 --> 00:52:54,036
          fucked another woman.

857
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,507
     Your sword.

858
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,596
                  (SIGHS)

859
00:53:04,665 --> 00:53:06,332
  I told you what would happen.

860
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,234
             All of you.

861
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:13,889
   I told you what would happen
   if you served me loyally.

862
00:53:15,576 --> 00:53:17,876
       And what would
       happen if you did not.

863
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,645
 What are you doing?
 What have you done?

864
00:53:20,714 --> 00:53:22,631
            If there are any
            who still question

865
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,566
          whether your new lord
          means what he says,

866
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:29,455
    here is the answer
    to your question.

867
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:31,973
        (CROWD GASPING)

868
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,867
                      No!
