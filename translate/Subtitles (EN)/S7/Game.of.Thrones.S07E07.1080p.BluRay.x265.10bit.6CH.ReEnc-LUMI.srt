Maybe it really is
all cocks in the end.

to side with the cockless.

was a problem.

You came pretty close.

71
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,278

I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick.

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,198
Perhaps you've been reconsidering
your allegiances.

Remember my offer.
Whatever they're paying you,

88
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,669
I'll pay double.

89
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,372
And that would be
double what now exactly?

90
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,958
Don't you worry about me.
I'm doing all right.

91
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,260
- Looking after myself.
- Are you?

92
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,632
Helping me to arrange this meeting

93
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,260
wasn't exactly
looking after yourself, was it?

94
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,966
You put yourself at risk.

95
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,301
I put yourself at risk.

00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,976

offered a bag of gold for,

98

it's not mine.

99

Now, thanks to me,
she's got two traitors' heads

100
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,356
coming right through her door.

101
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,687
She can lop them both off

102
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,613
as soon as she gets tired
of the clever words

103
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,156
that pour out their pieholes.

104

All thanks to
Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater.

I don't know what is.

Am I gonna die in this shit city?

113

You might.

114
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,158
And this is all your idea?

115
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,117
Seems every bad idea
has some Lannister cunt behind it.

And some Clegane cunt
to help them see it through.

I have your sister.

If you don't submit to me
here and now,

You're the smallest concern here.

Do you remember
when we discussed dwarf jokes?

has shown.

We have suffered
at each other's hands.

there would be no need
for this gathering.

we should settle our differences

and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

living in harmony.

00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,634
A general you can't negotiate with,

164
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,388
an army that doesn't leave corpses
behind on the battlefield.

165
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,429
Lord Tyrion tells me
a million people live in this city.

166
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,432
They're about to become a million more
soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

167
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,143
I imagine for most of them,
it would be an improvement.

168
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,032
This is serious.

169
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,735
I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

170
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,072
I don't think it's serious at all.
I think it's another bad joke.

171
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,703
If my brother, Jaime,
has informed me correctly,

172
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,329
you're asking me for a truce.

173
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,958
Yes. That's all.

174
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,957
That's all?

175
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,716
Pull back my armies and stand down
while you go on your monster hunt?

176
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,426
Or while you solidify
and expand your position?

177
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,930
Hard for me to know which it is
with my armies pulled back.

178
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,435
Until you return and march
on my capital with four times the men.

179
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,768
Your capital will be safe until
the Northern threat is dealt with.

180
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,354
You have my word.

181
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,440
The word of a would-be usurper.

182
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:24,574
There is no conversation
that will erase the last 50 years.

183
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,823
We have something to show you.

(CONTINUES SCREECHING)

186
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,927
We can destroy them by burning them.

(CONTINUES SCREECHING)

188
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,895
And we can destroy them
with dragonglass.

189
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,561
If we don't win this fight,

190
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,615
then that is the fate of every person
in the world.

(JON GRUNTS)

192

There is only one war that matters.

193
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,387
The Great War.

194
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,426
And it is here.

195
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,763
DAENERYS: I didn't believe it
until I saw them.

196
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,441
I saw them all.

197
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,771
- How many?
- Hundred thousand at least.

198
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:04,915
Can they swim?

199
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,049
No.

200
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,627
Good.

201
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,006
I'm taking the Iron Fleet
back to the Iron Islands.

202
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,092
What are you talking about?

203
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,303
I've been around the world.
I've seen everything.

204

Things you couldn't imagine.
And this...

205
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,645
This is the only thing I've ever seen
that terrifies me.

206
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,828
I'm going back to my island.

207
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,872
You should go back to yours.

208
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,581
When winter's over,
we'll be the only ones left alive.

CERSEI: He's right to be afraid.

210
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,634
And a coward to run.

211
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,897
If those things come for us,
there'll be no kingdoms to rule.

Everything we suffered
will have been for nothing.

Everything we lost
would have been for nothing.

In return, the King in the North

He will remain in the North
where he belongs.

He will not take up arms
against the Lannisters,

he will not choose sides.

- Not me?
- (CERSEI SCOFFS)

224
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,682
I would never ask it of you.

225
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,315
You would never agree to it,

226
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,860
and if you did, I would trust you
even less than I do now.

227
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,072
I ask it only of Ned Stark's son.

228
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,572
I know Ned Stark's son
will be true to his word.

229
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:15,087
I am true to my word, or I try to be.

230
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,971
That is why I cannot give you
what you ask.

231
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,059
I cannot serve two queens.

232
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:32,646
And I've already pledged myself
to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

233
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,700
Then there is nothing left to discuss.

237
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:02,717
It's been good to see you.

238
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,928
I imagine the next time will be
across a battlefield.

239
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,684
We both saw what just happened.

240
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,107
- We both saw that thing.
- Yes.

00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,401
And I'm not looking forward
to seeing more of them.

242

But I'm loyal to the queen,

243
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,900
and you're loyal to Sansa
and her dolt brother.

Oh, fuck loyalty.

245
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,324
Fuck loyalty?

246

This goes beyond houses and honor
and oaths.

- Talk to the queen.
- (SIGHS)

I'm grateful for your loyalty,

but my dragon died
so that we could be here.

252

If it's all for nothing,

253
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,485
then he died for nothing.

254
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,191

00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,948
TYRION: I'm pleased
you bent the knee to our queen.

256
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,325
I would have advised it had you asked.

257
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,454
But have you ever considered
learning how to lie

258
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,627
every now and then? Just a bit?

259
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,919
I'm not gonna swear an oath
I can't uphold.

260
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,130
Talk about my father if you want.

261
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,507
Tell me that's the attitude
that got him killed.

262
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,091
But when enough people
make false promises,

263
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,971
words stop meaning anything.

264
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,559
Then there are no more answers,
only better and better lies.

265
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,107
And lies won't help us in this fight.

266
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,355
TYRION: That is indeed a problem.

267
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:38,905
The more immediate problem
is that we're fucked.

268
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,493
Any ideas as to how we might change
that state of affairs?

269
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,158
Only one.

270
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,997
Everyone stays here.

271
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,704
And I go and talk to my sister.

272
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,918
I didn't come all this way
to have my Hand murdered.

273
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,795
I don't want Cersei
to murder me, either.

274
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,628
I could have stayed in my cell
and saved a great deal of trouble.

275
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,930
I did this. I should go.

276
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,223
She'll definitely murder you.

277
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,893
I go see my sister alone.

278
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,390
Or we all go home
and we're right back where we started.

279
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,285
You spoke with her?

280
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,667
At her, until she kicked me out.

281
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,671
She thinks I was an idiot
to trust you.

282
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,753
A lot of people
seem to think that, actually.

283
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,305
I'm about to step into a room with
the most murderous woman in the world

284
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:32,261
who's already tried to kill me twice,
that I know of.

285
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,016
Who's an idiot?

286
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:41,228
I suppose we should say goodbye,
one idiot to another.

287
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,832
I shouldn't be surprised.
I suppose she's your kind of woman.

288
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,383
A foreign whore
who doesn't know her place.

289
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,926
A foreign whore you can't abduct,
beat or intimidate.

290
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,056
That must be difficult for you.

291
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,633
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner

292
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,343
whom you've convinced
to bow down before her.

293
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:56,427
I didn't know about that.

294
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,478
And now you've got both working
towards the same goal.

295
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,557
The goal you've worked towards
your entire life.

296
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,609
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- The destruction of this family.

297
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,146
I am the one
preventing that from happening.

298
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,402
Daenerys didn't want to debate
and negotiate.

299
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,859
She didn't want to bring you words.

300
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,946
She wanted to bring you fire and blood
until I advised her otherwise.

301
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,657
I don't want to destroy our family.
I never have.

302
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,243
You killed our father.

303
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,205
After he sentenced me to death
for a crime I didn't commit.

304
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,334
Yes, I killed him.

305
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,132
Hate me for it if you want.

306
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,505
I hate myself for it
in spite of what he was.

307
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,678
In spite of what he did to me.

308
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,672
Oh, poor little man.

309
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,428
Your papa was mean to you.

310
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,219
Do you have any idea what you did
when you fired that crossbow?

311
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,396
You left us open.

312
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,768
You laid us bare for the vultures,

313
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,396
and the vultures came
and tore us apart.

314
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,020
You may not have killed Joffrey,

315
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,946
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

316
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,864
No one would have touched them
if Father was here.

317
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:51,941
No one would have dared...

318
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,492
I've never been more sorry

I will not hear it. Not from you.

I will not hear it!

All right.

322
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:06,756
You love your family,
and I have destroyed it.

So put an end to me.

If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

327
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,978
If it weren't for me,
you'd have two beautiful children.

It cost us our future.

If there's no future,
then why are we here?

342

Why did you allow me to come?

Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

Yes, Snow. Not what you hoped for,

but you must have hoped for something.

346

What did you hope for?

To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?

- Yes.
- Why?

351
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,159
Because I think she will
make the world a better place.

352
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,032
You said she'd destroy King's Landing.

353
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,865
She knows herself.

354
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:49,414
She chose an advisor who would
check her worst impulses

355
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,870
instead of feeding them.

That's the difference between you.

I don't care about
checking my worst impulses.

I know what it is,
I know what it means.

362
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,849
And when it came at me,
I didn't think about the world.

363
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,022
Not at all.

364
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,771
As soon as it opened its mouth,
the world disappeared for me

right down its black throat.

366
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,238
All I could think about
was keeping those gnashing teeth

away from the ones who matter most.

368

Away from my family.

Maybe Euron Greyjoy
had the right idea.

Extraordinary.

They filled people with wonder and awe
and we locked them in here.

she might not have been

"How well does that reason explain
what they say and what they do?"

So, tell me.
What's the worst thing she could want?

She could want me dead.

Because she thinks
I wronged my family.

Why did she come to Winterfell?

To kill me.

463
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,223
For marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

464
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,930
Why did she unearth the letter
Cersei made you write?

To provide proof of my betrayals.

To provide justification
after she murders me.

And after she murders you,
what does she become?

But if we're going to be
allies in this war,

484
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,852
it's important for the Northerners
to see us as allies.

485
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:17,736
If we sail to White Harbor together,
I think it sends a better message.

486
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,113
I've not come to conquer the North.

487
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,539
I'm coming to save the North.

488

We sail together.

489

Jon.

490
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,274
Could I speak with you?

What you did in King's Landing...

493
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,573
What you said...

494
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,833
You could've lied to Cersei.

495
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,839
About bending the knee to Daenerys.

496
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,258
You risked everything
to tell an enemy the truth.

497
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,971
We went down there to make peace.

498
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:34,096
And it seems to me,
we need to be honest with each other

499
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,556
if we're gonna fight together.

500
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,438
You've always known what was right.

501
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,158
Even when we were
all young and stupid,

502
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,576
you always knew.

503
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,203
Every step you take,

504
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,118
it's always the right step.

505
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,325
It's not.

506
00:45:54,418 --> 00:46:00,130
It may seem that way from the outside,
but I promise you, it's not true.

507
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,252
I've done plenty of things
that I regret.

No.

Not compared to you.

511
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,072
I always wanted to do the right thing.

512
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,736
Be the right kind of person.

But never knew what that meant.

514
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,076
It's always seemed like there was...

515
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,632
Like there was
an impossible choice I had to make.

516
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,844
Stark or Greyjoy.

517
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:55,557
Our father was more of a father to you
than yours ever was.

- And you betrayed him.

- Betrayed his memory.
- I did.

520

But you never lost him.

521
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,487
He's a part of you.

522
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,327
Just like he's a part of me.

It's not my place
to forgive you for all of it.

525
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,592
But what I can forgive, I do.

526

You don't need to choose.

527

Let's start with the simplest one.

594
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,772
You murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn.

595
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,478
You pushed her through the Moon Door
and watched her fall.

596
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,938
Do you deny it?

597
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,992
I did it to protect you.

598
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,944
You did it to take power in the Vale.

599
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,327
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

600
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,867
You gave Lysa
tears of Lys to poison him.

601
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:39,951
Do you deny it?

602
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,213
Whatever your aunt
might have told you,

603
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,584
she was a troubled woman.

604
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,253
She imagined enemies everywhere.

605
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,885
You had Aunt Lysa send
a letter to our parents

606
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:55,342
telling them it was the Lannisters
who murdered Jon Arryn

607
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,642
when really it was you.

608
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,103
The conflict between
the Starks and the Lannisters,

609
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,397
it was you who started it.
Do you deny it?

610
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,769
I know of no such letter.

611
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,399
You conspired with Cersei Lannister
and Joffrey Baratheon

612
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,730
to betray our father, Ned Stark.

613
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:11,487

he was imprisoned,

614

and later executed
on false charges of treason.

Do you deny it?

616
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,489
I deny it.

617
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,787
None of you were there
to see what happened.

618

None of you knows the truth.

619
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,583
You held a knife to his throat.

620
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,386
You said,
"I did warn you not to trust me."

621
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:40,391
You told our mother this knife
belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

622
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,601
But that was another one of your lies.

623
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,525
It was yours.

624
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,281
Lady Sansa,

625
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,653
I have known you
since you were a girl.

626
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,327
- I've protected you...
- Protected me?

627
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,412
By selling me to the Boltons?

628
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:03,702
If we could speak alone,
I can explain everything.

629
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,086
Sometimes when I'm trying
to understand a person's motives,

630
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:10,337
I play a little game.

631
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,632
I assume the worst.

632
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,432
What's the worst reason you have
for turning me against my sister?

633
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,557
That's what you do, isn't it?

634
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,105
That's what you've always done.

635
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,935
Turn family against family,
turn sister against sister.

636
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:30,395
That's what you did
to our mother and Aunt Lysa

637
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,572
and that's what you tried to do to us.

638
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:33,648
Sansa, please...

639
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,529
I'm a slow learner.

640
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,076
It's true.

641
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:38,903
But I learn.

642
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:42,581
Give me a chance to defend myself.
I deserve that.

643
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:49,998
I am Lord Protector of the Vale

644
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,209
and I command you to escort me
safely back to the Eyrie.

645
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,634
I think not.

646
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,591
Sansa, I beg you.

647
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,140
I loved your mother
since the time I was a boy.

648
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,937
And yet you betrayed her.

649
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,350
I loved you.

650
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,815
More than anyone.

651
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:14,814
And yet you betrayed me.

652
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,235
When you brought me
back to Winterfell,

653
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,616
you told me
there's no justice in the world.

654
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,619
Not unless we make it.

655
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,877
Thank you for all your many lessons,
Lord Baelish.

656
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,586
I will never forget them.

657
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:37,128
Sansa...

658
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,009
(CHOKING)

659
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,541
JAIME: Our men in King's Landing
will march north in three days' time.

660
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,499
It'll take us a fortnight just to
gather supplies for the train.

661
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:15,834
JAIME: We don't have a fortnight.

662
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,634
If the North falls, we fall.
Three days.

663
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,428
The remaining forces
in the Westerlands

664
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,130
will take the River Road east.

665
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,558
We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town
and march together to Winterfell.

666
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,851
Ser Jaime.

667
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,849
Your Grace.

668
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,522
My lords,
I need a moment with my brother.

669
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,398
LORD 1: Your Grace.
LORD 2: Your Grace.

670
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,355
What are you doing?

671
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:41,154
Preparing the expedition north.

672
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,826
Expedition north?

673
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:46,661
I always knew
you were the stupidest Lannister.

674
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,875
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

675
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,623
and you want to fight alongside them.

676
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,875
Are you a traitor or an idiot?

677
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,173
You pledged our forces
to fight our common enemy.

678
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,002
I'll say whatever I need to say
to ensure the survival of our house.

679
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:01,679
You expect me to trust the man
who murdered our father?

680
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:05,099
You expect me to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum?

681
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,051
To fight for the Dragon Queen?

682
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:10,934
You saw it with your own eyes.
You saw a dead man trying to kill us.

683
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,936
And I saw it burn.

684
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,813
If dragons can't stop them,

685
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,862
if Dothraki and Unsullied
and Northmen can't stop them,

686
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,940
how will our armies make a difference?

687
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,990
This isn't about noble houses.

688
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:23,943
This is about the living and the dead.

689
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,120
And I intend
to stay amongst the living.

690
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,081
Let the Stark boy and his new queen
defend the North.

691
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,242
We stay here where we've always been.

692
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,419
I made a promise.

693
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,547
Our child will rule Westeros.

694
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:43,550
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

695
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,840
The monsters are real.

696
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:50,978
The White Walkers, the dragons,
the Dothraki screamers.

697
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,351
All the frightening stories we heard
when we were young.

698
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:56,024
They're all real. So be it.

699
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,569
Let the monsters kill each other.

700
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,647
And while they battle in the North,

701
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,857
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

702
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,067
And then what?

703
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,700
And then we rule.

704
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,403
When the fighting in the North
is over,

705
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,410
someone wins.
You understand that, don't you?

706
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,206
If the dead win,
they march south and kill us all.

707
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,255
If the living win,
and we've betrayed them,

708
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,332
they march south and kill us all!

709
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:22,669
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

710
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,470
- Most of them will die in the North.
- I've faced them in the field.

711
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,423
We can't beat them.
We can't beat their dragons.

712
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,383
How many dragons
did you see at the pit?

713
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,968
- Two.
- What happened to the third?

714
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,974
For all we know,
it's guarding her fleet.

715
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,145
She came here with her dragons,
and her Dothraki, and her Unsullied.

716
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,272
She came here to show us
all her power.

717
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:43,072
No, something happened.
The dragons are vulnerable.

718
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:45,525
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

719
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,235
We don't have the support
of the other houses.

720
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,992
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

721
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,411
You should have listened more

722
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,914
when Father spoke
about the importance of gold.

723
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,745
I know it was boring for you.

724
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:01,041
You just wanted
to hunt and ride and fight.

725
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,675
But I listened, I learned.

726
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:08,590
Highgarden bought us
the most powerful army in Essos.

727
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,174
The Golden Company.

728
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:13,932
Twenty thousand men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

729
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:17,060
The Golden Company is not here.
They're in Essos.

730
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,939
How is a mercenary company in Essos
going to help us?

731
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:22,645
Do you really think Euron Greyjoy

732
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,106
turned tail and sailed back
to the Iron Islands?

733
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,281
Do you think he abandoned the chance
to marry the queen?

734
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,780
No one walks away from me.

735
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,701
He's sailing with his fleet to Essos.

736
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,582
He's going to ferry the Golden Company
back here

737
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,709
to help us win the war for Westeros.

738
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,209
You plotted with Euron Greyjoy

739
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,795
without telling me,
the commander of your armies?

740
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,556
And you conspired with Tyrion,

741
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:53,009
the man who murdered our father,
without telling me, your queen.

742
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,220
- I didn't conspire...
- You met with him in secret

743
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:56,596
without my consent.

744
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,393
You planned
to promote my enemy's interests.

745
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,475
That is the definition of conspiracy.

746
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:03,106
I pledged to ride north.

747
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,937
I intend to honor that pledge.

748
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,148
- Then that will be treason.
- Treason?

749
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:09,575
Disobeying your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

750
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:10,822
What would you call it?

751
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,656
Doesn't matter what I'd call it.

752
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,964
I told you no one walks away from me.

753
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,551
Are you going to order him to kill me?

754
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,303
I'm the only one you have left.

755
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:35,680
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

756
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,432
It's just me and you now.

757
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,555
There's one more yet to come.

758
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,813
Give the order then.

759
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,706
I don't believe you.

I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.

768
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,459
I remember everything.

You're a good man.

Oh. Well, thank you, but...

I'm not sure that I am.

What happened to you Beyond the Wall?

Oh!

I don't know what that means.

I can see things
that happened in the past.

Jon's the one to lead the fight
against the dead.

I know he is.

785

But he can't do it alone.

786
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,226
So, I've come here to help him.

787
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,012
He's on his way back to Winterfell.

788

With Daenerys Targaryen.

789

Oh.

792
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,154
He needs to know the truth.

- The truth about what?
- About himself.

No one knows. No one but me.

Jon isn't really my father's son.

796
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:39,220
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

797
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,681
He was born in a tower in Dorne.

It's not.

801
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,942
Dornish bastards are named Sand.

802
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,563
At the Citadel,
I transcribed a High Septon's diary.

803
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,524
He annulled Rhaegar's marriage
to Elia.

804
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,162
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

805
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:07,657
Are you certain?

806
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,493
It's what the High Septon wrote
in his private diary.

807
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,085
I don't know why he'd lie.

808
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,956
Is this something you can see?

809
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:21,713
RHAEGAR: Father, Smith, Warrior...
LYANNA: Father, Smith, Warrior...

810
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,300
- Mother, Maiden, Crone...
- Mother, Maiden, Crone...

811
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:27,134
- Stranger...
- Stranger...

812
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:30,221
- I am hers, and she is mine.
- I am his, and he is mine.

813
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,399
From this day,
until the end of my days.

814
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,278
BRAN: Robert's Rebellion
was built on a lie.

815
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:43,321
Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt,
or rape her.

816
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,328
He loved her.

817
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,046
And she loved him.

818
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:31,953
- And Jon...
- (BABY FUSSING)

819
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,412
Jon's real name...

820
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:42,797
(WHISPERING)
His name is Aegon Targaryen.

821
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,837
You have to protect him.

822
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,966
Promise me, Ned.

823
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,734
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

824
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,745
BRAN: He's never been a bastard.

825
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,254
He's the heir to the Iron Throne.

826
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,355
He needs to know.

827
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,106
We need to tell him.

828
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,164
ARYA: Are you all right?

829
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,205
SANSA: It's just strange.

830
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:01,250
In his own horrible way,
I believe he loved me.

831
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:06,676
You did the right thing.

832
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,004
You did it.

833
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,055
I'm just the executioner.

834
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,808
You passed the sentence.

835
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:16,929
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

836
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,431
Does that bother you?

837
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,687
I was never going to be
as good a lady as you.

838
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,731
So I had to be something else.

839
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,486
I never could have survived
what you survived.

840
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:33,905
You would have.

841
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:37,123
You're the strongest person I know.

842
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,667
I believe that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

843
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,249
Well...

844
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,551
Don't get used to it.

845
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,305
You're still very strange
and annoying.

846
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,847
"In winter, we must protect ourselves,

847
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:03,100
"look after one another."

848
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,149
Father.

01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:14,370
"When the snows fall
and the white winds blow,

850

"the lone wolf dies,
but the pack survives."

851
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,128
I miss him.

852
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:31,720
Me, too.

853
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,670

855

BERIC: It's a long way down.

856
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,724
TORMUND: Yeah. The crows keep
telling me I'll get used to it.
