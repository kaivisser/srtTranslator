1
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,104
- You all right?
- Hmm.

2
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,653
Never been north before?

3
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,200
Never seen snow before.

4
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,569
Beautiful, eh?

5
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,741
I can breathe again.

6
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,164
Down south,
the air smells like pigshit.

7
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,582
You've never been down south.

8
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,205
- I've been to Winterfell.
- That's the North.

9
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,536
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

10
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,288
GENDRY: How'd you live up here?

11
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,965
How'd you keep
your balls from freezing off?

12
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,043
TORMUND: You got to keep moving.
That's the secret.

13
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,672
Walking's good.

14
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,299
Fighting's better.

15
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,722
Fucking's best.

16
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:06,097
There's not a living woman
within a 100 miles of here.

17
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,269
We have to make do
with what we've got.

18
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,561
(SOFTLY)
This one is maybe not so smart.

19
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,396
Davos says he's a strong fighter.

20
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,731
Good.

21
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,067
That's more important
than being smart.

22
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,948
Smart people don't come up here
looking for the dead.

23
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,911
So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?

24
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,575
And?

25
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,913
And she'll only fight beside us
if I bend the knee.

26
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,168
You spent too much time
with the free folk.

27
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,046
Now you don't like kneeling.

28
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,305
Mance Rayder was a brave man.

29
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,223
A proud man.

30
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,848
The King-beyond-the-Wall
never bent the knee.

31
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,356
How many of his people died
for his pride?

32
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,030
You still mad at us, boy?

33
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,208
You sold me to a witch.

34
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,580
Priestess.

35
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,587
I'll admit,
it is a subtle distinction.

36
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,665
We're fighting a great war.

37
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,672
- Wars cost money.
- I wanted to be one of you.

38
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,505
I wanted to join the Brotherhood
but you sold me off.

39
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,884
Like a slave.

40
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,716
Do you know what she did to me?

41
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,302
She strapped me down on a bed,
she stripped me naked...

42
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,137
Sounds all right so far.

43
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,392
...and put leeches on me.

44
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,724
Was she naked, too?

45
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,103
She needed your blood.

46
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,935
Yes, thank you, I know that.

47
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,110
Could have been worse.

48
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,438
She wanted to kill me.

49
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,523
In fact, they would have killed me
if it wasn't for Davos...

50
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,904
But they didn't, did they?

51
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,701
So what you whinging about?

52
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,245
I'm not whinging.

53
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,156
Your lips are moving, and
you're complaining about something.

54
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,331
That's whinging.

55
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,874
This one's been killed six times.
You don't hear him bitching about it.

56
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,223
Good lad.

57
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,269
JON: The first time I went north
of the Wall was with your father.

58
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,187
He was a good man.

59
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,144
He deserved a better son.

60
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,272
Were you with him at the end?

61
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,866
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

62
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,243
But we avenged him.

63
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,281
I want you to know that.
Every mutineer found justice.

64
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,872
Can't think of a worse way
for him to go.

65
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,669
The Night's Watch was his life.

66
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,293
He would have died to protect
every one of those men.

67
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,590
And they butchered him.

68
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,713
I hate that he died that way.

69
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,467
My father was
the most honorable man I ever met.

70
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,174
He was good, all the way through.

71
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,931
And he died
on the executioner's block.

72
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,851
Your father wanted
to execute me, you know.

73
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,061
I heard.

74
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,317
He was in the right, of course.

75
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,737
Didn't make me hate him any less.

76
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,856
Glad he didn't catch you.

77
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,031
Me, too.

78
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,409
Your father gave me this sword.

79
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,083
Changed the pommel
from a bear to a wolf.

80
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,460
But it's still Longclaw.

81
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,971
Lord Commander Mormont

82
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,804
thought you'd never
come back to Westeros.

83
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,806
But you are back.

84
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,231
And it's been in your family
for centuries.

85
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,775
It's not right for me to have it.

86
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,777
He gave it to you.

87
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,738
I'm not his son.

88
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,667
I brought shame onto my house.

89
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,500
I broke my father's heart.

90
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,755
I've forfeited the right
to claim this sword.

91
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,392
It's yours.

92
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,224
May it serve you well,

93
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,639
and your children after you.

94
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,281
(SIGHS)

95
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,250
Father used to watch us from up here.

96
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,094
He wouldn't say much.

97
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,719
You probably don't remember.
You were inside knitting all the time.

98
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,885
I remember.

99
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,897
One time, the boys were
shooting arrows with Ser Rodrik.

100
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,276
I came out here after

101
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,445
and Bran had left his bow behind.

102
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,860
Just lying on the ground.

103
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,658
Ser Rodrik would have cuffed him
if he saw.

104
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,534
There was one arrow in the target.

105
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,291
There was no one around.

106
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,868
Just like now.

107
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,957
No one to stop me.

108
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,548
So I started shooting.

109
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,377
And every shot, I had to go up there

110
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,962
and get my one arrow and walk back
and shoot it again.

111
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,557
I wasn't very good.

112
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,645
Finally, I hit the bull's-eye.

113
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,348
Could have been the 20th shot,
or the 50th.

114
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,774
I don't remember.

115
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,190
But I hit the bull's-eye,
and I heard this...

116
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,155
I looked up,
and he's standing right here,

117
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,530
smiling down at me.

118
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,744
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules.

119
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,627
But he was smiling
so I knew it wasn't wrong.

120
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,338
The rules were wrong.

121
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,668
I was doing what I was
meant to be doing and he knew it.

122
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,551
Now he's dead.

123
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,933
Killed by the Lannisters.

124
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,977
With your help.

125
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,141
What?

126
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,277
That's your pretty handwriting.

127
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,613
Septa Mordane
used to crack my knuckles

128
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,323
'cause I couldn't write
as well as you.

129
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,170
"Robb, I write to you today
with heavy heart.

130
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,088
"Our good king Robert is dead.

131
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,503
"Killed from wounds
he took in a boar hunt..."

132
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,130
You don't have to read it. I remember.

133
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,757
"Father has been charged with treason.

134
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,681

"between the great houses
of Lannister and Stark.

140
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,446
"Your faithful sister, Sansa."

141
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,071
- They forced me to do it.
- Did they?

142
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,697
With a knife at your throat?

143
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,322
Did they put you on the rack
and stretch you

144
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,747
until your bones started to pop?

145
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,826
You don't know what it was like.
I was a child.

146
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,955
So was I.

147
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,458
I would have let them kill me
before I betrayed my family.

148
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,712
They told me it was the only way
to save Father.

149
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,884
And you were stupid enough
to believe them.

150
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,551
(SCOFFS)

151
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,845
I remember you.

152
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,843
Standing on the platform
with Joffrey and Cersei

153
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,595
while they dragged Father
to the block.

154
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,267
I remember the pretty dress
you were wearing,

155
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,185
I remember the fancy way
you did your hair.

156
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,811
- You were there?
- I was there.

157
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,609
Standing in the crowd
near Baelor's statue.

158
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,822
And what did you do?
Did you come running to the rescue?

159
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,776
Did you fight off the Lannisters
and save Father?

160
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,406
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't.

161
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,486
Just like me.

162
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,868
I didn't betray him.
I didn't betray Robb.

163
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,577
I didn't betray our entire family
for my beloved Joffrey!

164
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,881
You should be on your knees
thanking me.

165
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,590
We're standing in Winterfell again
because of me.

166
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,970
You didn't win it back.
Jon didn't win it back.

167
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,763
He lost the Battle of the Bastards.

168
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,677
The Knights of the Vale won the battle
and they rode north for me.

169
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,683
While you were off, where?
Traveling the world?

170
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,763
I was training.

171
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,519
Training.

172
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,317
Well, while you were training,

173
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,861
I suffered things
you can never imagine.

174
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,236
Oh, I don't know about that.
I can imagine quite a lot.

175
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,619
You never would have survived
what I survived.

176
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,747
I guess we'll never know.

177
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,703
What are you going to do
with that letter?

178
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,331
I don't know yet.

179
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,877
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

180
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,337
You're scared, aren't you?

181
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,014
What are you scared of?

182
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,636
You didn't commit any crimes.

183
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,597
No one's going to hang you.

184
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,178
- Arya...
- You're scared I'll show it to Jon

185
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,262
and he'll be angry.

186
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,815
No, that's not Jon.

187
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,063
He'll understand,
you were just a scared little girl.

188
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,899
All alone with the wicked Lannisters.

189
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,733
Do you know how happy Cersei would be
right now if she saw us fighting?

190
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,026
This is exactly what she wants,

191
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,986
it's what she's always wanted,
to tear us apart.

192
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,788
You're scared the Northern lords
will read it.

193
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,625
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa

194
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,668
if they knew how she did
Cersei's bidding.

195
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,086
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

196
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,300
She's younger than you were,
when you wrote this.

197
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,425
Are you going to say,
"But I was just a child"?

198
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,683
You're angry.

199
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,475
Sometimes anger makes people
do unfortunate things.

200
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,647
Sometimes fear makes them
do unfortunate things.

201
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,898
I'll go with anger.

202
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,639
You're the one they call the Dog.

203
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,015
- Fuck off.
- (CHUCKLES)

204
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,138
They told me you were mean.

205
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,690
Were you born mean,
or you just hate wildlings?

206
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,813
I don't give two shits
about wildlings.

207
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,401
- Gingers, I hate.
- Gingers are beautiful.

208
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,739
We are kissed by fire.

209
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,150
Just like you.

210
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,361
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

211
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,206
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

212
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,170
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

213
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,918
And ever since, you've been mean.

214
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,670
Will you fuck off?

215
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,592
I don't think you're truly mean.

216
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,340
You have sad eyes.

217
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,134
You want to suck my dick, is that it?

218
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,715
"Dick"?

219
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,345
- Cock.
- Ah.

220
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,843
Dick.

221
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,136
I like it.

222
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,180
I bet you do.

223
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,016
TORMUND: Nope, it's pussy for me.

224
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,853
I have a beauty waiting for me
back in Winterfell.

225
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,688
If I ever get back there.

226
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,364
Yellow hair,

227
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,782
blue eyes,

228
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,860
the tallest woman you've ever seen.

229
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,490
Almost as tall as you.

230
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,530
Brienne of Tarth.

231
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,706
You know her?

232
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,993
You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

233
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,791
Well, not with her yet.

234
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,622
But I see the way she looks at me.

235
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,048
HOUND: How does she look at you?

236
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,467
Like she wants to carve you up
and eat your liver?

237
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,131
You do know her.

238
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,633
We've met.

239
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,589
I want to make babies with her.

240
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,801
Think of them. Great big monsters.

241
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,727
They'd conquer the world.

242
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,477
How did a mad fucker like you
live this long?

243
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,982
I'm good at killing people.

244
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,362
You don't look much like him.

245
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,609
Who's that?

246
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,815
Your father.

247
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,781
I suppose you favor your mother.

248
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,870
You knew him?

249
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,161
Of course I did. When he was Hand,

250
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,996
he sent me off hunting
for the Mountain.

251
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,459
Your wildling friend told me
the Red Woman brought you back.

252
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,383
Thoros has brought me back six times.

253
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,546
We both serve the same lord.

254
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,888
I serve the North.

255
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,929
The North didn't raise you
from the dead.

256
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,055
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

257
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,854
I don't know anything about him.
I don't know what he wants from me.

258
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,602
He wants you alive.

259
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:43,974
Why?

260
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,813
I don't know.

261
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,483
That's all anyone can tell me.
"I don't know."

262
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,534
So what's the point in serving a god
if none of us knows what he wants?

263
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,745
I think about that all the time.

264
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,039
I don't think it's our purpose
to understand.

265
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,080
Except one thing.

266
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,831
We're soldiers.

267
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,004
We have to know
what we're fighting for.

268
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,920
I'm not fighting so some man or woman

269
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,548
I barely know can sit
on a throne made of swords.

270
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,425
So, what are you fighting for?

271
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,305
Life.

272
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,475
Death is the enemy.

273
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,562
The first enemy, and the last.

274
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,807
But we all die.

275
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,690
The enemy always wins.

276
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,064
And we still need to fight him.

277
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,281
That's all I know.

278
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,902
You and I won't find much joy
while we're here.

279
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,696
But we can keep others alive.

280
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,871
We can defend those
who can't defend themselves.

281
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,964
"I am the shield
that guards the realms of men."

282
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,001
Maybe we don't need to understand
any more than that.

283
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,048
Maybe that's enough.

284
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,004
Aye.

285
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,090
Maybe that's enough.

286
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,360
HOUND: That's what I saw in the fire.

287
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,362
A mountain like an arrowhead.

288
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,737
THOROS: Are you sure?

289
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,196
We're getting close.

290
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,081
DAENERYS:
Do you know what I like about you?

291
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,668
I honestly don't.

292
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,128
You're not a hero.

293
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,880
Oh.

294
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,886
I've been heroic on occasion.

295
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,594
I once charged through the Mud Gate
of King's Landing and...

296
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,270
DAENERYS:
I don't want you to be a hero.

297
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,140
Heroes do stupid things, and they die.

298
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:52,107
Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this...

299
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,020
Jon Snow.

300
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,944
They all try to outdo each other.

301
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,117
Who can do the stupidest,
bravest thing.

302
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,779
TYRION: It's interesting,
these heroes you name.

303
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,910
Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this...

304
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:06,825
Jon Snow.

305
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,164
They all fell in love with you.

306
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,875
Jon Snow's not in love with me.

307
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,456
TYRION: Oh, my mistake.

308
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,132
I suppose he stares at you longingly

309
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,756
because he's hopeful
for a successful military alliance.

310
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,723
He's too little for me.

311
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,680
I didn't mean...

312
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,932
As heroes go, he is quite little.

313
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,226
I know you're brave.

314
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,225
I wouldn't have chosen
a coward as my Hand.

315
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,402
So...

316
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,528
If all goes well,
I'll finally get to meet your sister.

317
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,864
From everything
you've told me about her,

318
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,950
she'd rather murder me
than speak with me.

319
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,621
Oh...

320
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,837
First she'd torture you
in some horrible way,

321
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,129
then she'd murder you.

322
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,963
Nobody trusts my sister
less than I do, believe me.

323
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,670
But if we go to the capital,

324
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,632
we'll go with two armies,
we'll go with three dragons.

325
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,886
Anyone touches you,

326
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,389
King's Landing burns down
to the foundation stones.

327
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,471
And right now she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

328
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,600
Of course she is.

329
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,023
And she's wondering what trap
you're laying for her.

330
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,475
DAENERYS: Are we?

331
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,981
Laying any traps?

332
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,279
If we want to create
a new and better world,

333
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,203
I'm not sure deceit and mass murder
is the best way to start.

334
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,031
Which war was won
without deceit and mass murder?

335
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,578
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless
if you're going to win the throne.

336
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,709
You'll need to inspire
a degree of fear.

337
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,957
But fear is all Cersei has.

338
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,676
It's all my father had, and Joffrey.

339
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,920
It makes their power brittle.

340
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,882
Because everyone beneath them
longs to see them dead.

341
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,135
Aegon Targaryen got
quite a long way on fear.

342
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,310
He did.

343
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,477
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

344
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,057
Aegon built a wheel.

345
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,435
If that's the kind of queen
you want to be,

346
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,519
how are you different

347
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,195
from all the other tyrants
that came before you?

348
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,648
So we walk into the lion's den.

349
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,489
My brother promised me he'd keep
a grip on the Lannister forces.

350
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,788
Forgive me, but I don't care
about any Lannister promises.

351
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,490
Except yours.

352
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:15,378
And I promised him I'd keep you
from doing anything impulsive.

353
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,082
Impulsive?

354
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,008
This will be a difficult negotiation.

355
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,007
We are sitting down with people
who want to see us both headless.

356
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,139
My sister's likely to say
something provocative.

357
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,219
And?

358
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,977
And you have been known
to lose your temper from time to time.

359
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,399
As all great leaders do.

360
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,852
When have I lost my temper?

361
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,396
Burning the Tarlys, for instance.

362
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,776
DAENERYS: That was not impulsive.

363
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,526
That was necessary.

364
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,406
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

365
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,281
Perhaps the father needed to die,
and not the son.

366
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,038
Perhaps they both needed
time to contemplate their mistakes

367
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,335
in the solitude of a cold cell.

368
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,880
We had no time
to discuss the possibilities

369
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,798
before you ended their possibilities.

370
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,171
One could be forgiven for thinking

371
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,923
you're taking your family's side
in this debate.

372
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,005
I am taking their side.

373
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,135
You need to take your enemy's side

374
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,932
if you're going to see things
the way they do.

375
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,726
And you need to see things
the way they do

376
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,849
if you're going to anticipate
their actions,

377
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,101
respond effectively, and beat them.

378
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,476
Which I want you to do very much.

379
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,904
Because I believe in you
and in the world you want to build.

380
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,158
But the world you want to build
doesn't get built all at once.

381
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,236
Probably not in a single lifetime.

382
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,327
How do we ensure your vision endures?

383
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,205
After you break the wheel, how do
we make sure it stays broken?

384
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,916
You want to know who sits
on the Iron Throne after I'm dead.

385
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,170
Is that it?

386
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,799
You say you can't have children.

387
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,965
But there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

388
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,016
The Night's Watch has one method.

389

The ironborn, for all
their many flaws, have another.

390

We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

391
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,808
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows
fly towards you

392
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,313
when you fought
on the Blackwater Rush.

393
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,395
And I saw hundreds of arrows miss.

394
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,072
But any one of them could have
found your heart and ended you.

395
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,241
You've been thinking about my death
quite a bit, haven't you?

396
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,530
Is this one of the items you discussed
with your brother in King's Landing?

397
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,910
I'm trying to serve you
by planning for the long term.

398
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,411
Perhaps if you planned
for the short term,

399
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,664
we wouldn't have lost
Dorne and Highgarden.

01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:48,035
Those faces, what are they?

648
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,579
You want to do the asking?

649
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,032
Are you sure?

650
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,368
The Game of Faces
didn't turn out so well

651
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:56,998
for the last person
who asked me questions.

652
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,954
Tell me what they are.

653
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:05,303
We both wanted to be other people
when we were younger.

654
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,305
You wanted to be a queen.

655
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:12,268
To sit next to a handsome young king
on the Iron Throne.

656
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,395
I wanted to be a knight.

657
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:19,226
To pick up a sword like Father
and go off to battle.

658
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:24,026
Neither of us got to be
the other person, did we?

659
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,316
The world doesn't just let
girls decide

660
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,526
what they're going to be.

661
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,827
But I can now.
With the faces, I can choose.

662
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,205
I can become someone else.

663
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:39,995
Speak in their voice.

664
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,248
Live in their skin.

665
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,340
I could even become you.

666
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:58,351
I wonder what it would feel like

667
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,854
to wear those pretty dresses,

668
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,604
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

669
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,408
All I'd need to find out

670
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,612
is your face.

671
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,168
(GASPS SOFTLY)

672
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,504
I'm sorry.

673
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:16,592
I'm so sorry.

674
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,318
I wish I could take it back.

675
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,655
I wish we'd never gone.

676
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,740
I don't.

677
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,086
If we hadn't gone,
I wouldn't have seen.

678
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:47,873
You have to see it to know.

679
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,218
Now I know.

680
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,511
The dragons are my children.

681
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,635
They're the only children
I'll ever have.

682
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:01,729
Do you understand?

683
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:11,022
We are going to destroy
the Night King and his army.

684
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,565
And we'll do it together.

685
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:17,328
You have my word.

686
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,666
Thank you, Dany.

687
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,744
Dany?

688
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:27,546
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

689
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,673
Who was the last person
to call me that?

690
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:33,465
I'm not sure, was it my brother?

691
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,553
Mmm.

692
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,222
Not the company you want to keep.

693
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,429
All right.

694
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:42,928
Not "Dany."

695
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,810
How about "my queen"?

696
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:56,109
I'd bend the knee, but...

697
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,907
What about those
who swore allegiance to you?

698
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:01,997
They'll all come to see you
for what you are.

699
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,053
I hope I deserve it.

700
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:22,926
You do.

701
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,166
You should get some rest.

702
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,420
