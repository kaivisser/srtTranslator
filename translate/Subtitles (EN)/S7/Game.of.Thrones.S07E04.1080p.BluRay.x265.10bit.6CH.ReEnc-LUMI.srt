1
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,156
(HORSE WHINNIES)

2
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,172
SOLDIER 1: Hold that wagon!

3
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,056
You've just won the biggest prize
in the world.

4
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,187
What could you possibly have
to be upset about?

5
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,937
Come on, you can tell me.

6
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,819
Queen of Thorns
give you one last prick in the balls

7
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,241
before saying goodbye?

8
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,861
I'll save my confessions
for the High Septon.

9
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,991
BRONN: There is no more High Septon.

10
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,244
No, there isn't, is there?

11
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,626
There is still
the question of my prize.

12
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,089
That's a lot of money I just gave you.

13
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,586
It's not a castle.

14
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,553
How 'bout that one? It's available.

15
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,755
You don't want Highgarden.

16
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,719
- I beg to differ.
- We're at war.

17
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,642
Daenerys Targaryen could come
and take it back

18
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,844
the day after you move in.

19
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,143
Besides, think of the upkeep.

20
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,271
The more you own,
the more it weighs you down.

21
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,068
Oh, is that why
you're so fucking glum, hey?

22
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,235
All your new riches weighing you down?

23
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,152
SOLDIER 2: Move up!

24
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,236
JAIME: They're not mine.
This all belongs to the Iron Bank.

25
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,076
See? We pay our debts.

26
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,998
Right. Just not to me.

27
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,625
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
formerly of

28
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,002
whatever nameless shit heap
you're from,

29
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:41,336
with a saddlebag full of gold,
complaining about not getting paid.

30
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,133
When we win this war,

31
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,216
all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms
will be yours to choose from,

32
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,925
with no one left
to take them away from you.

33
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,229
Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign
will be quiet and peaceable.

34
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,022
- Stranger things have happened.
- Like what?

35
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,021
The granaries are being emptied,
and loaded into wagons, my lord.

36
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,104
The current harvest?

37
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,441
We have teams of men collecting it,
from all the farms in the Reach.

38
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,743
Ser Bronn,
will you accompany the Tarlys

39
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,037
and help them accelerate this process?

40
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,080
I'm not much for shoveling wheat.

41
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:15,379
No, but motivating reluctant farmers
to hand over their harvest...

42
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,171
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

43
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,135
- My lord.
- My lord.

44
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,633
My lord.

45
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,438
TYCHO: I must say,
I don't think the Iron Bank

46
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:43,068
has ever had a debt of this magnitude
repaid in a single installment.

47
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,319
I always considered your father
a very effective and efficient man,

48
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,746
but you appear to be
redefining those terms entirely.

49
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,953
You're too kind, my lord.

50
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,290
I am neither kind nor a lord,
Your Grace.

51
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,543
I am merely an instrument
of the institution I represent.

52
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,047
Its well-being is a matter of
arithmetic, not sentiment.

53
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,220
And the current arithmetic
is outstanding.

54
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,677
- The gold...
- Is on its way.

55
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,761
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

56
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,560
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

57
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,108
They've grown rather fond of
your interest payments.

58
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,358
We must devise a way
to raise their spirits.

59
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:27,613
Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance
in some current venture.

60
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,781
My only venture at this moment is

61
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,113
reestablishing control
over this continent

62
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,290
and every person on it.

63
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,368
I see a great deal of potential
in that venture.

64
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:41,460
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

65
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,540
It will, indeed.

66
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,798
I need to expand my armies, my navies.

67
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,346
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to
the Golden Company in Essos.

68
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,422
I know them well.

69
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,009
They have helped us recover
significant sums

70
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,766
from parties
who'd fallen into deep arrears.

71
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,768
That's good to hear.

72
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,067
I, too, would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

73
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:07,653
Rest assured, Your Grace, you can
count on the Iron Bank's support.

74
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,735
As soon as the gold arrives.

75
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,827
LITTLEFINGER: This is for you.

76
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,539
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

77
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,545
but your mother fought him off.

78
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,846
The other dagger,
the one that took her life,

79
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:43,276
I would have stopped that dagger
with my own heart, if I could have.

80
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,943
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

81
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,860
But I am here for her now.

82
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:57,324
To do what she would have done.
To protect her children.

83
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:05,923
Anything I can do for you, Brandon,
you need only ask.

84
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,635
Do you know who this belonged to?

85
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,463
No.

86
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,931
That very question was what started
the War of the Five Kings.

87
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,520
In a way, that dagger
made you what you are today.

88
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,728
Forced from your home, driven out
to the wilds beyond the Wall.

89
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,490
I imagine you've seen things
most men wouldn't believe.

90
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,204
To go through all of that
and make your way home again,

91
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:49,543
only to find such chaos in the world,
I can only imagine...

92
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,844
Chaos is a ladder.

93
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,349
(DOOR OPENS)

94
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,893
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

95
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,775
I'm sorry to have disturbed you,
Lord Stark.

96
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,397
I'm not Lord Stark.

97
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,160
What's that?

98
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,370
Maester Wolkan built it for me
so I can move around more easily.

99
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,874
It's a very good idea.

100
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,133
You're leaving.

101
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,005
I don't want to leave you. But when...

102
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,683
When they come,
I need to be with my family.

103
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,646
You're safe.
Well, safe as anyone can be now.

104
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,103
You don't need me anymore.

105
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,561
No, I don't.

106
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,157
That's all you've got to say?

107
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,195
Thank you.

108
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,663
"Thank you"?

109
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,332
For helping me.

110
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:11,003
My brother died for you.
Hodor and Summer died for you.

111
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,459
I almost died for you.

112
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,965
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

113
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,636
Not anymore.

114
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,184
I remember what it felt like
to be Brandon Stark.

115
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,778
But I remember so much else now.

116
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,449
(VOICE BREAKING)
You died in that cave.

117
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:23,951
SOLDIER 1: I did. The kitchen girl,
the redhead with the behind.

118
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,372
SOLDIER 2:
The only thing in the kitchen

119
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,245
that you've put
your cock in is the liver.

120
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,712
'Ey up. Where you going?

121
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,085
In there. I live here.

122
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,002
- Fuck off.
- I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.

123
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,590
(LAUGHS AND SNORTS)

124
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,508
Arya Stark's dead.

125
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,183
Send for Maester Luwin,
or Ser Rodrik.

126
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,263
They'll tell you who I am.

127
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,440
There's no Rodrik here.

128
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,142
Maester's named Wolkan.

129
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,525
Go ask Jon Snow then,
the King in the North.

130
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,947
- He's my brother.
- He's 1,000 miles away.

131
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,741
Look, it's cold and we're busy,

132
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,990
so, you know, best fuck off.

133
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,196
Mmm.

134
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,998
If Jon's gone,
who's in charge of Winterfell?

135
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,041
The Lady of Winterfell? Lady Stark?

136
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,747
- Which Lady Stark?
- SOLDIER 2: You tell us.

137
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,628
You're the one
impersonating her sister.

138
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,470
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

139
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,425
Lady Sansa is too busy
to waste her breath on you.

140
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,599
Just like us.

141
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,350
So, for the last time, fuck off.
(GRUNTS)

142
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,270
I'm getting into this castle
one way or another.

143
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,947
If I'm not who I say I am,
I won't last long.

144
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,778
But if I am, and Sansa finds out
you turned me away...

145
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:58,087
Right, you sit there.
Right there. Don't move.

146
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,086
Right, go tell Lady Stark,
I'll watch her.

147
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,638
SOLDIER 2: I ain't telling Lady Stark.
You can tell her.

148
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,632
SOLDIER 1: Why me?

149
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,079
- You're gonna tell her.
- I'm not.

150
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,833
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit you
right in the fucking face,

151
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,414
as hard as I can.

152
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,095
SOLDIER 1: We told her to wait.

153
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,097
We were standing
right next to her, and...

154
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,304
SOLDIER 2: And when we'd turned
around, she'd gone, my lady.

155
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,934
She was nothing.
Some winter town girl.

156
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,392
- Comes in asking for Ser Rodrik...
- Rodrik, yeah.

157

- And Maester Luwin.
- Luwin, yeah.

158
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,572
And don't trouble yourself over it,
my lady. We'll find her.

159
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,155
You don't have to.
I know where she is.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

161
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,840
Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?

162
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,548
Yes.

163
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,822
You shouldn't have
run from the guards.

164
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,363
I didn't run. You need better guards.

166
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,214
It suits you. Lady Stark.

00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,671
- Jon left you in charge?
- He did.

168
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,593
I hope he comes back soon.

169
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,049
I remember how happy he was to see me.

170
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,432
When he sees you,
his heart will probably stop.

It doesn't look like him.

Should've been carved by someone
who knew his face.

174

Everyone who knew his face is dead.

We're not.

They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?

177
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,803
- I wish I had.
- Hmm.

178
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,892
Me, too. I was angry
when I heard someone else had done it.

However long my list got,
he was always first.

How did you get back to Winterfell?

183
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,205
It's a long story.
I imagine yours is, too.

184
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,208
Yes. Not a very pleasant one.

185

Mine neither.

186
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:34,841
- But our stories aren't over yet.
- No, they're not.

Arya...

188
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,270
Bran's home, too.

189
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,934
You came home.

190
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,788
I saw you at the Crossroads.

191
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,248
- You saw me?
- I see quite a lot now.

192
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,009
Bran has visions.

193
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,259
I thought you might go
to King's Landing.

194
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,475
- So did I.
- Why would you go back there?

195
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,182
Cersei's on her list of names.

196
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,449
Who else is on your list?

197
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,319
Most of them are dead already.

198
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,342
- Where did you get this?
- Littlefinger gave it to me.

199
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,879
Littlefinger? He's here?

200
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,555
He has declared for House Stark.

201
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,884
- Why would he give you a dagger?
- He thought I'd want it.

202
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,595
- Why?
- Because it was meant to kill me.

203
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,775
The cutthroat. After your fall?

204
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,352
Why would a cutthroat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

205
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,530
Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.

206
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,652
He's not a generous man.

207

He wouldn't give you anything

208

unless he thought
he was getting something back.

209

It doesn't matter.

What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

I don't want it.

Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.

213
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,635
It's wasted on a cripple.

214
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,756
Catelyn Stark would be proud.

215
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,252
You kept your vow.

There is something else
I want to show you, Your Grace.

231
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,921
The Children of the Forest made these.

232

When?

A very long time ago.

They were right here,
standing where we're standing.

235

Before there were Targaryens or Starks
or Lannisters.

00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,064
Maybe even before there were men.

No.

238

They were here together,

Doing what? Fighting each other?

240
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,849
They fought together,
against their common enemy.

241
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,232
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

242

Together.

243
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,364

if we're going to survive.

'Cause the enemy is real.
It's always been real.

without my armies and my dragons?

Not after everything they've suffered.

251
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,348
They will if their king does.

252
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,597
They chose you to lead them.

253
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,483
They chose you to protect them.

00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,071
Isn't their survival more important
than your pride?

All my allies are gone.

I've been sitting here on this island.

from the Reach.

It's still the right plan.

The right plan?

Your strategy has lost us Dorne,
the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

If I've underestimated our enemies...

to fight them?

I never thought that
dragons would exist again.

No one did.

The people who follow you know that
you made something impossible happen.

291

Maybe that helps them believe that

you can make
other impossible things happen.

Of course.

Is the custom different in Naath?

345

We don't have marriage in Naath,

doesn't exist.

Oh, I'm sorry.

If I may, how did a slave girl come to
advise Daenerys Targaryen?
