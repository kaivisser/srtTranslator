(THUNDER CRACKING)

2
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,731
TYRION: On a night like this,
you came into the world.

3
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,057
VARYS: I remember that storm.

4
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,646
All the dogs in King's Landing
howled through the night.

5
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,480
DAENERYS: I wish I could remember it.

6
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,446
I always thought
this would be a homecoming.

7
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,276
Doesn't feel like home.

8
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,454
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

9
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,700
Good.

10
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,075
DAENERYS: Not so many lions.

11
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,877
VARYS: Cersei controls fewer than
half the Seven Kingdoms.

12
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,167
The lords of Westeros despise her.

13
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,589
Even before your arrival,

14
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,009
they plotted against her. Now...

15
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,712
They cry out for their true queen?

16
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,593
They drink secret toasts to my health?

17
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,095
People used to tell my brother
that sort of thing,

18
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,848
and he was stupid enough
to believe them.

19
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,483
If Viserys had three dragons

20
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,185
and an army at his back,

21
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,191
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

22
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,773
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you,

23
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,154
but you're not here
to be queen of the ashes.

24
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,745
No.

25
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,989
TYRION: We can take the Seven Kingdoms

26
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,120
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

27
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,544
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

28
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,041
the game is won.

29
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,003
With the Tyrell army
and the Dornish on our side,

30
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,925
we have powerful allies in the South.

31
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,088
I never properly thanked you for that.

32
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,598
They joined our side, my queen,

33
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,892
because they believe in you.

34
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,479
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

35
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,727
I did.

36
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,729
And then you served the man
who overthrew him.

37
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,900
I had a choice, Your Grace.

38
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,229
Serve Robert Baratheon
or face the headman's ax.

39
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,405
But you didn't serve him long.

40
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,027
You turned against him.

41
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,446
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

42
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,285
There have been few rulers in history

43
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,241
as cruel as the Mad King.

44
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,827
Robert was neither mad nor cruel,

45
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,459
he simply had no interest
in being king.

46
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,916
So, you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

47
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,550
Your Grace...

48
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,425
When I was ready to drink myself
into a small coffin,

49
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,381
Lord Varys told me
about a queen in the east who...

50
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,842
Before I came to power,

51
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,594
you favored my brother.

52
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,015
All your spies, your little birds,

53
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,352
did they tell you Viserys was
cruel, stupid and weak?

54
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,981
Would those qualities
have made for a good king,

55
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,531
in your learned opinion?

56
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,027
Until your marriage
to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

57
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,328
I knew nothing about you,

58
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,873
save your existence and that
you were said to be beautiful.

59
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,076
So, you and your friends
traded me like a prized horse

60
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,456
to the Dothraki.

61
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,458
Which you turned to your advantage.

62
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,505
Who gave the order to kill me?

63
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,011
King Robert.

64
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,388
Who hired the assassins?

65
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,643
Who sent word to Essos
to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

66
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,847
Your Grace, I did
what had to be done to...

67
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,022
To keep yourself alive.

68
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,270
Lord Varys has proven himself
a loyal servant.

69
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,193
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

70
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,895
If he dislikes one monarch,

71
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,981
he conspires to crown the next one.

72
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,067
What kind of servant is that?

73
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,277
The kind the realm needs.

74
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,580
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

75
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,750
As long as I have my eyes,
I'll use them.

76
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,294
I wasn't born into a great house.

77
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,089
I came from nothing.

78
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,009
I was sold as a slave,
and carved up as an offering.

79
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,343
When I was a child,

80
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,713
I lived in alleys, gutters,
abandoned houses.

81
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,307
You wish to know
where my true loyalties lie?

82
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,430
Not with any king or queen,

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,681
but with the people.

84
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,021
The people who suffer under despots

85
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,598
and prosper under just rule.

86
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,934
The people whose hearts
you aim to win.

87
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,819
If you demand blind allegiance,

88
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,490
I respect your wishes.

89
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:13,363
Grey Worm can behead me,
or your dragons can devour me.

90
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,244
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

91
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,372
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne,

92
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,748
because I choose you.

93
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,545
Because I know that people have
no better chance than you.

94
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,926
Swear this to me, Varys.

95
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,731
If you ever think
I'm failing the people,

96
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,934
you won't conspire behind my back.

97
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,645
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

98
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,731
and you'll tell me
how I'm failing them.

99
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,655
I swear it, my queen.

100
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,034
And I swear this.

101
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,081
If you ever betray me,
I'll burn you alive.

102
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,379
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

103
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,516
GREY WORM: Forgive me, my queen.

104
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,562
A red priestess from Asshai
has come to see you.

(CONVERSING IN VALYRIAN)

Queen Daenerys.

107
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,871
I was a slave once,

108
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,456
bought and sold,

109
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,416
scourged and branded.

110
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,161
It is an honor to meet
the Breaker of Chains.

111
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,549
The red priests helped
bring peace to Meereen.

112
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,509
You are very welcome here.

113
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,258
What is your name?

114
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,089
I am called Melisandre.

115
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,760
(IN ENGLISH) She once served another
who wanted the Iron Throne.

116
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,893
It didn't end well
for Stannis Baratheon, did it?

117
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,061
No. It didn't.

118
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,019
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

119
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,396
We've just decided to pardon

those who once served the wrong king.

121
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,280
The Lord of Light
doesn't have many followers

122
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,956
in Westeros, does he?

123
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,249
MELISANDRE: Not yet.

124
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,961
But even those who don't worship
the Lord can serve his cause.

125
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,834
What does your Lord expect from me?

126
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:28,956
(SPEAKS VALYRIAN)

127
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,173
The Long Night is coming.

128
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,836
Only the prince who was promised
can bring the dawn.

129
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,638
(IN ENGLISH) "The prince who was
promised will bring the dawn."

130
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,971
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

131
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,144
MISSANDEI: Your Grace, forgive me,
but your translation

132
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,347
is not quite accurate.

133
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,024
That noun has no gender
in High Valyrian.

134
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,023
So, the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

135
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,856
"The prince or princess
who was promised

136
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,315
"will bring the dawn."

137
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,401
Doesn't really
roll off the tongue, does it?

138
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,861
No, but I like it better.

139
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,535
And you believe
this prophecy refers to me?

140
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,241
Prophecies are dangerous things.

141
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,545
I believe you have a role to play.

142
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,129
As does another,
the King in the North, Jon Snow.

143
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,425
Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?

144
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,675
You know him?

145
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,091
I traveled with him to the Wall

146
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,392
when he joined the Night's Watch.

147
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,060
VARYS: And why do you think
the Lord of Light

148
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,853
singled out this Jon Snow?

149
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,556
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

150
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,313
As Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch,

151
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,690
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

152
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,273
to protect them from grave danger.

153
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,447
As King in the North,

154
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,159
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

155
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,703
so together they may face
their common enemy.

156
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,702
He sounds like quite a man.

157
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,162
Summon Jon Snow.

158
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,413
Let him stand before you

159
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,541
and tell you the things
that have happened to him.

160
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,749
The things he has seen
with his own eyes.

161
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,127
I can't speak to prophecies

162
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,929

00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,239
Balerion the Dread.

323
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,665
The beast that Aegon rode
across the sea.

324
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,539
His flames forged the Iron Throne,

325
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,501
and brought the Seven Kingdoms
to heel.

326
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,803
Powerful.

327
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,471
But not invincible.

328
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:10,856
Apparently, one of Daenerys'
dragons was wounded by spears

329
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,024
in the fighting pits of Meereen.

330
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,694
And if they can be wounded,

331
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,113
they can be killed.

332
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,239
The finest artillators and
blacksmiths in King's Landing

333
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,117
have been laboring
day and night, Your Grace.

334
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,289
If you'll kindly pull that lever.

335
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,189
YARA: If you want the Iron Throne,

336
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,770
take it.

337
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,401
We have an army, a fleet
and three dragons.

338
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,573
We should hit
King's Landing now, hard,

339
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,942
with everything we have.

340
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,197
The city will fall within a day.

341
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,619
TYRION: If we turn the dragons loose,

342
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,538
tens of thousands will die
in the firestorms.

343
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,865
It's called war.

344
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,168
You don't have the stomach
for it, scurry back into hiding.

345
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,495
I know how you wage war.

346
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,999
We don't poison little girls here.

347
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,295
- Myrcella was innocent.
- ELLARIA: She was a Lannister.

348
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,503
There are no innocent Lannisters.

349
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,464
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

350
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,594
DAENERYS: That's enough.

351
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,059
Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen,

352
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,556
you will treat him with respect.

353
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,017
I am not here
to be queen of the ashes.

354
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,192
That's very nice to hear.

355
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,989
Of course, I can't remember a queen

356
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,988
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

357
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,571
The common people loved her,
the nobles loved her.

358
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,201
And what is left of her now?

359
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,123
Ashes.

360
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,838
Commoners, nobles, they're all
just children, really.

361
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,379
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

362
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,337
I'm grateful to you,
Lady Olenna, for your counsel.

363
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,717
I'm grateful to all of you.

364
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,138
But you have chosen to follow me.

365
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,473
I will not attack King's Landing.

366
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,351
We will not attack King's Landing.

367
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,109
Then how do you mean
to take the Iron Throne?

368
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,436
By asking nicely?

369
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,780
We will lay siege to the capital,

370
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,573
surrounding the city on all sides.

371
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,363
Cersei will have the Iron Throne,

372
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,911
but no food for her army
or the people.

373
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,785
But we won't use
Dothraki and Unsullied.

374
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,787
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

375
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,334
by appealing to their loyalty,

376
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,911
their love for their country.

377
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,879
If we besiege the city
with foreigners,

378
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,623
we prove her point.

379
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,379
Our army should be Westerosi.

380
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,552
And I suppose
we're providing the Westerosi?

381
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,011
TYRION: You are.

382
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,391
Lady Greyjoy will
escort you home to Sunspear.

383
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,142
And her Iron Fleet
will ferry the Dornish army

384
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,349
back up to King's Landing.

385
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,101
The Dornish will lay siege
to the capital,

386
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,106
alongside the Tyrell army.

387
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,860
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

388
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:11,036
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

389
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,328
Forgive me for asking,

390
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,451
but why did you bother
to bring your own?

391
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:19,002
The Unsullied
will have another objective.

392
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,579
For decades, House Lannister has been

393
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,414
the true power in Westeros

394
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,502
and the seat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

395
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,006
Grey Worm and the Unsullied
will sail for the Rock,

396
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,506
and take it.

397
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,152
Do I have your support?

398
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,787
You have mine.

399
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,788
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

400
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,963
Thank you, all.

401
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,459

may I speak with you alone?

(DOOR CLOSES)

and not love for me.

405
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,275
But I swear to you, she will pay
for what she's done.

406
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,191
And we will bring peace
back to Westeros.

407
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,564
Peace?

408
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,866
Do you think that's what we had
under your father?

409
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,659
Or his father? Or his?

410
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,281
Peace never lasts, my dear.

411

Will you take a bit of advice
from an old woman?

He's a clever man, your Hand.

413

I've known a great many clever men.

I ignored them.

417
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,054
The lords of Westeros are sheep.

418

Are you a sheep?

No. You're a dragon.

One is frightened of the ocean.

They make the boy sleep
with dogs, or climb a cliff.

They throw him in the water.

If you're going to write

467

you have to do the research.

as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.
