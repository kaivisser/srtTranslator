You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

163
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,884
Thank you.

164
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,346
You're good at this, you know.

165
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,548
At what?

166
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,803
At ruling.

167
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,554
- No.
- You are. You are.

168
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,225
They respect you,
they really do.

169
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,151
- But you have to...
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

170
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,354
Why are you laughing?

171
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,780
What did Father used to say?

172
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,280
Everything before the word "but"
is horseshit.

173
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,611
He never said that to me.

174
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,321
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

175
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,749
SANSA: Because he was trying
to protect us.

176
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,833
He never wanted us to see

177
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,456
how dirty the world really is,

178
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,210
but Father couldn't protect me
and neither can you.

179
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,380
Stop trying.

180
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,174
All right, I'll stop trying
to protect you,

181
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,672
and you stop trying to
undermine me.

182
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,469
I'm not trying to undermine you!

183
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,933
You have to be smarter
than Father.

184
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,015
You need to be smarter
than Robb.

185
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,722
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

186
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,899
and they both
lost their heads for it.

187
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,942
And how should I be smarter?

188
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,564
By listening to you?

189
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,863
Would that be so terrible?

190
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,782
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

191
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,737
A raven from King's Landing,
Your Grace.

192
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,006
JON: Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

193
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,958
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

194
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,463
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

195
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,011
What does she want?

196
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,966
(SIGHS) Come to King's Landing,

197
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,643
bend the knee or suffer the fate
of all traitors.

198
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,767
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

199
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,644
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

200
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,191
I'm consumed with the Night King

201
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,813
because I've seen him.

202
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,362
And believe me, you'd think of
little else if you had, too.

203
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,440
We still have a wall between us
and the Night King.

204
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,024
There's nothing
between us and Cersei.

205
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,781
JON: There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

206
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:37,861
Winter is here.

207
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,617
The Lannisters are
a Southern army.

208
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,414
They never range this far north.

209
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,289
You're the military man,
but I know her.

210
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,286
If you're her enemy,
she'll never stop

211
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,962
until she's destroyed you.

212
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,962
Everyone who's ever crossed her,
she's found a way to murder.

213
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,130
You almost sound
as if you admire her.

214
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,934
I learned a great deal from her.

215
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,348
What is this?

216
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,218
It's what we've been waiting for
our whole lives.

217
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,929
It's what Father trained us for,
whether he knew it or not.

218
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,559
JAIME: He knew it.

219
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,391
Made me memorize
every damn city, town,

220
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,067
lake, forest and mountain.

221
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,941
It's ours now.
We just have to take it.

222
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,983
You've been quiet
since you came home.

223
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,448
- Are you angry with me?
- No, not angry.

224
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,950
Are you afraid of me?

225
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,907
Should I be?

226
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,257
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen
Tyrion to be her Hand.

227
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,714
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

228
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,716
hoping to take back
her father's throne.

229
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,757
Our little brother,

230
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,968
the one you love so much,

231
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,223
the one you set free,

232
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,227
the one who murdered our father
and our first-born son.

233
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,560
Now he stands beside our enemies
and gives them counsel.

234
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,400
He's out there somewhere,
at the head of an armada.

235
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,868
Where will they land?

236
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,160
Dragonstone.

237
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,909
They have deep-water ports
for the ships.

238
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,957
Stannis left
the castle unoccupied,

239
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,254
and that's where she was born.

240
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,547
Enemies to the east.

241
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,458
Enemies to the south.

242
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,340
Ellaria Sand
and her brood of bitches.

243
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,217
Enemies to the west.

244
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,141
Olenna, the old cunt.
Another traitor.

245
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,687
Enemies to the north.

246
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,641
Ned Stark's bastard has been
named King in the North

247
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,023
and that murdering whore, Sansa,
stands beside him.

248
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,274
Enemies everywhere.
We're surrounded by traitors.

249
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,106
You're in command
of the Lannister army now.

250
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,658
- How do we proceed?
- Winter's here.

251
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,443
We can't win a war

252
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,574
if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

253
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,579
The Tyrells have the grain.
The Tyrells have the livestock.

254
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,333
Will the Tyrell bannermen stand
alongside a Dothraki horde

255
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,958
and Unsullied slave soldiers?

256
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,507
If they think Daenerys will win.

257
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,550
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

258
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,755
Right now,
we look like the losing side.

259
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,677
I'm the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

260
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,226
Three kingdoms, at best.

261
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,434
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

262
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,186
I understand
we're in a war for survival.

263
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,232
I understand
whoever loses, dies.

264
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,402
I understand whoever wins

265
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,650
could launch a dynasty
that lasts a thousand years.

266
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,447
A dynasty for whom?

267
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,743
Our children are dead.

268
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,695
We're the last of us.

269
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,830
A dynasty for us, then.

270
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,668
We never talked about Tommen.

271
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,544
There's nothing to say.

272
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,375
Our baby boy killed himself.

273
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,085
He betrayed me.

274
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,590
He betrayed us both.

275
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,388
Should we spend our days
mourning the dead,

276
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,261
Mother, Father,
and all our children?

277
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,343
- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

278
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,553
But they're ashes now,

279
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,933
and we're still flesh and blood.

280
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,936
We're the last Lannisters.
The last ones who count.

281
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,983
Even Lannisters can't survive
without allies.

282
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,068
Where are our allies now?

283
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,788
You saw what happened
to Walder Frey and his family.

284
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,081
CERSEI: I heard.

285
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,957
How could we ever trust
a man like that?

286
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,626
JAIME: We couldn't.
He was a useless old coward.

287
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,705
But the Freys supported us.

288
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,913
Now they're all dead.

289
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,624
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

290
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,084
We need allies.

291
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,967
Stronger, better allies.
We can't win this war alone.

292
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,221
Do you think I listened
to Father for 40 years

293
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,052
and learned nothing?

294
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,147
(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)

295
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,090
JAIME: The Greyjoys...

296
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,847
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

297
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:53,973
Not all of them.

298
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,929
Well, it looks like all of them.

299
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,264
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

300
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,691
the new
King of the Iron Islands.

301
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,440
You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

302
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,899
There you are.

303
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,446
How are they better allies?

304
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,866
How are they
different from the Freys?

305
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,284
They both broke their promises

306
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,656
and murdered
their former friends

307
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,782
as soon as it suited them.

308
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,785
So does everyone,
when it suits them.

309
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,992
Unlike the Freys,
they have ships.

310
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,202
And they're good at killing.

311
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,254
They're not good at anything.
I know the ironborn.

312
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,332
They're bitter,
angry little people.

313
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,633
All they know how to do
is steal things they can't build

314
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,709
or grow themselves.

315
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,758
Euron Greyjoy
didn't come here for that.

316
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,555
Oh, what did he come here for then?

317
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,765
A queen.

318
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,357
EURON: The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

319
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,817
they turned on me. (CHUCKLES)

320
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,992
Their own uncle.

321
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,571
They stole my best ships
and ran. (CHUCKLES)

322
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,990
Sailed them
right across the world

323
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,825
and gave them
to the Dragon Queen

324
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,535
so she could bring her armies

325
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,586
here to attack you.

326
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,799
It's nothing
compared to the treason

327
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,298
you suffered
at the hands of a family member,

328
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,719
from what I hear.

329
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,388
But still, it bothers me.

330
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,885
Murdering them
would make me feel a lot better.

331
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,439
And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

332
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,141
are fighting for the same side,

333
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:28,067
I thought we rightful monarchs
could murder them together.

334
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,114
You're not a rightful monarch,
though, are you?

335
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,161
The Greyjoys
rebelled against the throne

336
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,621
for the right to be monarchs.

337
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:48,049
But as I recall,
you were soundly defeated.

338
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,256
Come to mention it,

339
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,588
weren't you the one
who started that rebellion

340
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,345
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

341
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,305
You certainly caught us there.

342
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,012
- (CHUCKLES)
- JAIME: Very smart move on your part.

343
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:05,021
Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

344
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,559
I was there.

345
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,441
I remember very well.

346
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,896
I saw you.

347
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,777
I heard so much talk.

348
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,152
"The best in the world.
No one can stop him."

349
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,700
I didn't believe it,
to be honest.

350
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,916
But I must say, when you rushed
through the breach

351
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,288
and started cutting people down,

352
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,081
it was glorious.

353
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,708
Like a dance.

354
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,878
The people I was cutting down
were your own kin.

355
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,845
The place was getting crowded.

356
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,883
I enjoyed watching it.
I truly did.

357
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,934
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

358
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,103
A good thing for me.

359
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:46,058
If you hadn't crushed us,
I wouldn't have gone into exile.

360
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,855
And if I hadn't done that,

361
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,647
I wouldn't be the greatest
captain in the 14 seas.

362
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,357
If not the most humble.

363
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:56,819
You're not humble.

364
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,826
You're the queen
of a great nation.

365
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,749
You don't care
about the Iron Islands.

366
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,669
They're nothing but rocks

367
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,621
and birdshit and...

368
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,254
And a lot of
very unattractive people.

369
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,922
The Iron Fleet,
on the other hand,

370
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,763
that's something else entirely.

371
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,342
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

372
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,219
With the Iron Fleet,

373
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,053
you own the seas.

374
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,561
You can defeat
the invaders in the East

375
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,858
and the pretenders
in the North and South.

376
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,274
What do you want in return?

377
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,775
Ever since I was a little boy,

378
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,281
I wanted to grow up and marry

379
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,321
the most beautiful woman
in the world.

380
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,831
So, here I am,

381
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,459
with a thousand ships

382
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,207
and two good hands.

383
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,756
(CHUCKLES)

384
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,213
I decline your proposal.

385
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,717
Why?

386
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,927
You're not trustworthy.

387
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,139
You've broken
promises to allies before

388
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,266
and murdered them
at the nearest opportunity.

389
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,855
You murdered your own brother.

390
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,438
You should try it.
Feels wonderful.

391
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:15,443
(CHUCKLES) I don't expect you
to trust me outright.

392
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,740
You need proof
of my honest intentions.

393
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,112
In my experience,

394
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,037
the surest way to
a woman's heart is with a gift.

395
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,163
A priceless gift.

396
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,165
I won't return to King's Landing

397
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,868
until I have that for you.

SAMWELL: Archmaester,
I was wondering...

422
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,036
- What's the weight?
- Um...

423
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,035
A hundred and forty-seven.

424
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,132
SAMWELL: I was wondering if
you'd considered my proposition.

425
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,010
I don't remember
your proposition.

426
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,678
SAMWELL: I asked you if,

427
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,676
in light of what
I'd seen in the North,

428
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,759
if I could have access to the
restricted area of the library.

429
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,515
That area is reserved
for maesters.

430
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,017
- Are you a maester?
- No.

431
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,895
Not a very strong proposition,
is it?

432
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,694
SAMWELL: Archmaester, with respect,

433
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,664
I've seen them.
The Army of the Dead.

434
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,079
The White Walkers.

435
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,458
I was sent here to learn
how to defeat them,

436
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,834
but everyone in the Citadel,

437
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,836
those who'll even talk to me,

438
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,543
they all doubt the Walkers
ever existed in the first place.

439
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,137
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

440
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,213
It's their job.

441
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,098
But the tales of the Long Night
can't be pure fabrication.

442
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,690
Too many similarities from
unconnected sources.

443
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,443
Sources in the restricted area?

444
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,023
The very same.

445
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:13,407
And the simplest explanation
for your grating obsession

446
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,160
with the White Walkers is that
you're telling the truth,

447
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,791
and that you saw
what you say you saw.

448
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,295
So, you believe me.

449
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,667
I do.

450
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,875
You'll finish
weighing that heart?

451
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,887
That makes you the only person
south of the Twins who does.

452
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,806
We're not like the people
south of the Twins.

453
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,058
And we're not like the people
north of the Twins.

454
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,726
In the Citadel,
we lead different lives

455
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,402
for different reasons.

456
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,906
We are this world's memory,
Samwell Tarly.

457
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,905
Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

458
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,112
Don't remember any meal
but the last.

459
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,243
Can't see forward to any
but the next.

460
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,917
And every time you leave
the house and shut the door,

461
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,538
they howl
like you're gone forever.

462
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,460
When Robert's Rebellion
was raging,

463
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,632
people thought the end was near.

464
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,380
The end
of the Targaryen dynasty.

465
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,677
"How will we survive?"

466
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,097
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward,

467
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,140
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush.

468
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,181
"The end is near!
How will we survive?"

469
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,309
And thousands of years before
that, during the Long Night,

470
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,561
we can forgive them for
thinking it truly was the end.

471
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,608
But it wasn't. None of it was.

472
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,489
The Wall has stood
through it all.

473
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,451
And every winter that ever came
has ended.

474
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,912
Be a good lad. Clean this up.

he wants me alive.

645
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,385
If he's so all-powerful,

646
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,937
why doesn't he just tell you
what the fuck he wants?

647
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,102
Clegane. Come over here.

Don't worry.

I want to show you something.

650

It's my fucking luck I end up
with a band of fire worshippers.

651
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,869
Aye. Almost seems like
divine justice.

652

There's no divine justice,
you dumb cunt.

and no one wants to tell me.
