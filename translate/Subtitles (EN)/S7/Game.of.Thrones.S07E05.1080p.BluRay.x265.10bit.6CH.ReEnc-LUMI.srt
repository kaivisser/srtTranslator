Ending the war. Killing her.

between you and her?

00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,160
That I've come to destroy your cities,

29
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,214
burn down your homes,
murder you and orphan your children.

I'm not here to murder,

a better place than we found it.

You will not kneel?

41
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,748
I already have a queen.

42
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,288
TYRION: My sister.

43
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,836
She wasn't your queen
until recently, though, was she?

44
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,965
When she murdered your rightful queen,

45
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,918
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

46
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,971
So, it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

47
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,014
There are no easy choices in war.

48
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,853
Say what you will about your sister,
she was born in Westeros.

49
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,106
She's lived here all her life.

50
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,605
You, on the other hand,

51
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,692
murdered your own father,

52
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,951
and chose to support
a foreign invader,

53
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,282
one with no ties to this land,

54
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,616
an army of savages at her back.

55
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,377
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

56
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,714
I respect that.

57
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,630
Perhaps he could take the black,
Your Grace.

58
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,091
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

59
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,343
He'd be invaluable at the Wall.

60
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,178
You cannot send me to the Wall.

61
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,894
You are not my queen.

62
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,530
You will have to kill me, too.

63

one great house from the world.

69

Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

70
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,978
I will not.

from a man's head

many will take it.

How many men did we lose?

92
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,359
We haven't done a full accounting.

93
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,616
It's not only armies that win wars.

94
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,241
We have the Tyrell gold,
we have the Iron Bank behind us,

95
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,826
we can buy mercenaries.

96
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,038
Not the same as our men,

97
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,715
but they'll fight if
they're well paid, which they will be.

98
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,134
I just saw the Dothraki fight.

99
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,048
They'll beat any mercenary army.
They'll beat any army I've ever seen.

100
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,759

it was sport.

103

they couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

104
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,564
This isn't a war we can win.

105
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,521
So, what do we do?

106
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,907
Sue for peace?

107
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,154
I sit on her father's throne,
the father you betrayed and murdered.

108
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,031
And in her mind, she's winning.

109
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,208
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

110
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,752
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf,

111
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,626
by way of apology
for murdering our father and son.

112
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,678
He didn't.

113

you saw his body.

After all this time,

00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,564
- it still amazes me...
- It was Olenna.

118
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,769
She confessed before she died.

119
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:44,740
And this was before or after she drank
the poison you so kindly provided her?

120
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,366
After.

121
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,992
And you believed her.

122
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,910
If you were Olenna,

123
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,708
would you rather have seen
your granddaughter

124
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,456
married to Joffrey or Tommen?

125
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,257
Which one would Margaery
have been better able to control?

126
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,836
Which one would have made Olenna
the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?

127
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,008
She was telling the truth.

128
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,556
I shouldn't have listened to you.

129
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,731
She should have died screaming.

130
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,608
She's dead, like her son,
her grandchildren, her whole house.

00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,320
And if we don't find
a way out of this war,

132
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,445
we'll follow them.

133
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,656
So, we fight and die
or we submit and die.

134
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,736
I know my choice.

135

This man says
he is your friend, Khaleesi.

166
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,373
He is my friend.

167
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,090
Your Grace.

168
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,264
Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont,
an old friend.

169
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,266
I served with your father.

170
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,439
He was a great man.

171
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,726
You look strong.

172
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,821
You found a cure?

173
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,773
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

174
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,652
I return to your service, my queen.

175
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,029
If you'll have me.

176
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,326
It would be my honor.

Ravens. We need to send ravens.

182
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,727
I put very little stock in it myself.

many a good Maester's wits.

A crippled boy claims
to have seen dead men

on the march Beyond the Wall,

192
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,797
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

193
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,502
EBROSE: Yes, it is a bit much.

194
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,134
- Still, we ought to write back for...
- SAMWELL: Brandon Stark.

195
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,223
The crippled boy.

196
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,887
Do you know him?

197
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:10,147
I led him through the Wall years ago.
I saw him go Beyond the Wall.

198
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,850
And?

199
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,187
Somehow, a crippled boy survived
for years Beyond the Wall

200
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,522
when no one else could.

201
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,529
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

202
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,408
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

203
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,491
Perhaps you need more scribing work
to discipline your mind.

204
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,998
I sense a more detailed proposal
is forthcoming?

(CLEARS THROAT)

Everyone in Westeros trusts
and respects you.

207
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,557
If you tell people the threat is real,
they'll believe it.

208
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,978
If you advise all the lords to send
their men north to hold the Wall,

209
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,058
they'll do it.

210
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,354
And if you tell every maester
in the Citadel

211
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,945
to search every word of every
faded scroll about the Long Night,

212
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,361
they may find something that lets us
defeat the Army of the Dead for good.

213
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:12,618
It could be done.

214
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,215
And this news could be authentic.
It's possible.

215
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,798
It's also possible that this message
is part of a ploy by the Dragon Queen

216
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,177
to lure southern armies away

217
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,930
from the lands
they are currently defending,

218
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,726
to open those lands to easy conquest.

219
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,272
That does seem far more likely
than magic birds talking to cripples.

220
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,689
Archmaester, please.

221
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,318
It's real.

222
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,146
I've seen it.

223
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,278
We will write to Maester Wolkan
at Winterfell for clarification.

224
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,697
I promise you, we will get
to the truth of it one way or another.

225
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,783
- Archmaester, please...
- That will be all, Tarly.

MAESTER: It brings to mind
the work of Jenny of Oldstones,

227

from the Children of the Forest.

228
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,465
Don't forget the prophet Lodos,
who promised

229
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:05,136
that the Drowned God would rise up
and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

230
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,633
Oh, Lodos. (CHUCKLES)

231
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,975
Is he the one whose father and brother
were just burned alive?

232
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,934
I'm afraid so.

233
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,270
A horrible business.

234
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,397
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

235
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,649
He's a good lad.

236
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,860
Right.

237
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,533
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

238
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,242
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

239
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,577
That's why they're rulers.

240
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,547
She gave Tarly a choice.

241
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,464
A man who had taken up
arms against her.

242
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,295
What else could she do?

243
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,423
Not burn him alive alongside his son?

244
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,765
I am her Hand, not her head.
I can't make her decisions for her.

245
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,722
That's what I used to tell myself
about her father.

246
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,109
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

247
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,487
I was only a purveyor of information.

248
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,326
It's what I told myself
when I watched them beg for mercy.

249
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,490
"I'm not the one doing it."

250
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,710
And the pitch of their screams
rose higher.

251
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,332
"I'm not the one doing it."

252
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,417
When their hair caught fire,

253
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,171
and the smell of their burning flesh
filled the Throne Room,

254
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,968
"I'm not the one doing it."

255
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,646
TYRION: Daenerys is not her father.

256
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,563
And she never will be.

257
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,312
With the right counsel.

258
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,940
You need to find
a way to make her listen.

259
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,113
Who's that for?

260
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,111
Jon Snow.

261
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,197
Did you read it?

262
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,162
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

263
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,924
What's it say?

264
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,301
Nothing good.

265
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,760
I thought Arya was dead.

266
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,346
I thought Bran was dead.

267
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,024
I'm happy for you.

268
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,690
You don't look happy.

269
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,573
Bran saw the Night King and his army
marching towards Eastwatch.

270
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,694
If they make it past the Wall...

271
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,371
The Wall has kept them out
for thousands of years, presumably.

272
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,824
I need to go home.

273
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,662
You said you don't have enough men.

274
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,540
We'll fight with the men we have.

275
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,830
Unless you'll join us?

276
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,211
And give the country to Cersei?

277
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,543
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

278
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,970
Perhaps not.

279
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,804
Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead
is nothing but a story

280
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,261
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

281
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,725
What if we prove her wrong?

282
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,229
I don't think she'll come see the dead
at my invitation.

283
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,486
So, bring the dead to her.

284
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,822
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

285
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,400
We don't have to bring the whole army.

286
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,569
Only one soldier.

287
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,745
Is that possible?

288
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,793
The first wight I ever saw

289
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,871
was brought into Castle Black
from Beyond the Wall.

290
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,631
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing,

291
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,128
and show her the truth.

292
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,211
Anything you bring back
will be useless

293
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,012
unless Cersei grants us an audience

294
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,512
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

295
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,059
the moment we set foot in the capital.

296
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,353
The only person she listens to
is Jaime.

297
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,724
He might listen to me.

298
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,150
And how would you
get into King's Landing?

299
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,740
I can smuggle you in.

300
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,615
But if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

301
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,245
I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.

302
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,205
Well, it'll all be for nothing if
we don't have one of these dead men.

303
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,790
Fair point.
How do you propose to find one?

304
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,134
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

305
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,760
You asked me to find a cure
so I could serve you.

306
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,970
Allow me to serve you.

307
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,563
The Free Folk will help us.

308
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,233
They know the real north
better than anyone.

309
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,904
They won't follow Ser Jorah.

310
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,107
They won't have to.

311
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,664
DAVOS: You can't lead
a raid Beyond the Wall.

312
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,034
You're not in
the Night's Watch anymore,

313
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,244
you're King in the North.

314
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,669
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

315
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,999
I'm the only one here who knows them.

316
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,464
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

317
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,757
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

318
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,892
I am a king.

319
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,723
And I came here knowing that
you could have your men behead me

320
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,523
or your dragons burn me alive.

321
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,568
I put my trust in you, a stranger,

322
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,400
because I knew it was
the best chance for my people,

323
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,406
for all our people.

324
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:26,329
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger,

325
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,461
'cause it's our best chance.

to rule us, my lady.

You are very kind, my lords.

334
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,431
But Jon is our king.
He is doing what he thinks is best.

SANSA: I warned Jon this would happen.

337
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,812
That he couldn't leave the North

338
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,444
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

339
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,526
He didn't,
he trusted you to hold it for him.

340
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,574
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern Lords are proud.

These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

And? (SIGHS)

343
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,623
Nothing.

344
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,175
Don't do that.

345
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,545
What?

346
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,096
Say what you mean.

347
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,221
You always liked nice things.

348
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,055
Made you feel better than everyone.

349
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,311
Are you angry with me?

350
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,365
They were insulting Jon,
and you sat there and listened.

351
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,067
I listened to their complaints,

352
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,949
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

353
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,951
Their opinions are important to you.

354
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,917
Glover has 500 men
and Royce has 2,000.

355
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,370
Offend them and Jon loses his army.

356
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,546
Not if they lose their heads first.

357
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,088
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

358
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,888
We took it back.

359
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,642
And the Mormonts, and the Hornwoods,
and the wildlings, and the Vale.

360
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,060
All of us, working together.

361
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:55,390
Now, I'm sure cutting off heads
is very satisfying,

362
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:59,023
but that's not the way
you get people to work together.

363
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,658
And if Jon doesn't come back,
you'll need their support.

364
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,037
So you can work together
to give you what you really want.

365
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,074
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

366
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,628
You're thinking it right now.

367
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,458
You don't want to be.

368
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,003
But the thought just won't go away.

369
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,594
I have work to do.

370
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,014
My lady.

371
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,031
Last time I was here,
I killed my father with a crossbow.

372
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,075
Last time I was here,
you killed my son with wildfire.

373
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,790
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

374
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,756
The guards hardly ever patrol it.
Too many steps.

375
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,179
You're not staying here?

376
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,306
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

377
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,475
What if someone takes the boat?

378
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,933
Then we're fucked. Best hurry.

379
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,114
JAIME: We don't have time for this.

380
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,941
We should be preparing the city
for a siege.

381
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,117
The Dothraki are coming.

382
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,910
BRONN: All the more reason
for you to train.

383
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,205
Unless you plan
on fighting Dothraki 12-year-olds.

384
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,658
JAIME: Well, I seem to recall them
giving you a bit of trouble as well.

385
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,493
And here I am, ready to train.

386
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,873
JAIME: Why down here?

387
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,420
I don't think you want people to see
how you look swinging that thing yet.

388
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,927
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

389
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,763
Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.

390
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,686
I'll leave you to it.

391
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,770
I needed to see you.

392
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,069
And I knew you'd never agree to meet.

393
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,824
You made me look like a complete fool.

394
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,573
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock.

395
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,917
But you were three steps ahead of me.

396
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,371
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

397
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,664
Father would have been proud.

398
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,294
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me...

399
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,962
I once told Bronn

400
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,011
that if I ever saw you again,
I'd cut you in half.

401
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,392
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

402
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,437
He was going to execute me.

403
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,155
He knew I was innocent.

404
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,609
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did.

405
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,989
He hated me because of what I am.

406
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,037
A little monster sent to punish him.

407
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,454
Did he...

408
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,120
Did he think... Did he think
I wanted to be born this way?

409
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,921
- Did he think I chose it...
- What do you want?

410
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,929
Daenerys will win this war.

411
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,683
You're a military man.

412
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,476
You must know
there's no way around that.

413
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,106
Daenerys is not her father.

414
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,018
She's even willing
to suspend hostilities

415
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,069
if Cersei agrees to certain terms.

416
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:33,571
You want Cersei to bend the knee,
you can ask her yourself.

417
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,822
I... I don't. And Daenerys doesn't.

418
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,954
Not right now, anyway.

419
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,333
She has a more important request.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

421
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,617
Wasn't sure I'd find you.

422
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,009
Thought you might still be rowing.

423
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,507
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

424
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,558
I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.

425
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:44,016
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

426
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:47,106
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

427
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,273
Haven't been here in years.

428
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,396
Why should they recognize me?

429
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,066
Sometimes I hardly do.

430
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,275
Nothing fucks you harder than time.

431
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,827
Anybody give you any trouble?

432
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,793
Here I am, arming Lannisters,
and I never get a second look.

433
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,829
But you were right.

434
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,293
Safest place for me
was right under the queen's nose.

435
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,003
Don't be so sure.

436
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,087
Safety is never
a permanent state of affairs.

437
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,339
Bad things are coming.

438
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,263
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

439
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:27,767
Well, I think you'll need
to understand...

440
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,018
I'm ready. Let's go.

441
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,650
You should know
what you're heading into.

442
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,945
What do you think I've been thinking
about with every swing of the hammer?

443
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:40,027
How happy I am making weapons
for the family that killed my father?

444
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,406
The family that tried to kill me?

445

(GENDRY SCOFFS)

446
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,531
I've been getting ready.

447
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,418
Never knew what for, but I've always
known I'd know it when it comes.

448
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,669
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

449
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,675
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

450
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,470
But this,

451
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,674
this I know.

452
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,150
Keep your father's name to yourself.

453
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,354
Situation's complicated
enough already.

454
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,023
Well, who should I say I am?

455
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,870
I told you, Clovis,
if we don't get out of here soon,

456
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,538
- someone's going to...
- SOLDIER 1: You there!

457
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,328
No weapons, friends. I promise.

458
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,920
What can I do for you?

459
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,206
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

460
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,214
SOLDIER 2: The docks are that way.
DAVOS: That they are.

461
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:43,048
I try to stay away from them
to avoid good men such as yourselves.

462
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,100
Still five gold dragons?

463
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,099
- Are you joking?
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

464
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,055
You must be even older than you look.

465
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,978
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen?

466
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,309
Apiece.

467
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,777
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

468
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,656
SOLDIER 1: What's in the boat?

469
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,291
Not more gold.

470
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,132
- Wine? I like wine.
- Mmm.

471
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,675
Or hams.

472
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,136
Come have a look.

473
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,929
Fermented crab.

474
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,440
- What?
- DAVOS: Fermented crab.

475
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,485
One bucket of this triples
a brothel's earnings for the week.

476
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,856
A man thinks he's done, he's ready
to go back to his loving family.

477
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,694
But before he gets his breeches up,

478
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:47,495
his lady of the hour pops
a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.

Our fathers trusted each other.
Why shouldn't we?

549

I saw your father once at Winterfell.

550

I met yours. In my shop.

551

- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

All I ever knew was that
they fought together, and won.

554
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,493
Ser Davos told me where you're going,
Your Grace, and why.

555

Let me come with you.

00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,166
Don't be a fool, you're not a soldier.

557
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,123
No, but I'm a fighter.

558
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,339
And he won't be needing a smith
with a sword like that.

559
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,055
You know how to use one?

560
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,466
Well, that's a problem.

561
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,096
Prefer a hammer.

562
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,855
He can handle himself.

563
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,643
We could use the help.

564
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:53,944

about what's up there,

a ripe old age.

572

You may not believe it,
but I've missed you, Mormont.

575

This is the coin the slaver gave me

576
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,033
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

577
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,291
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

578

at least you won't have to deal

It's when a man sets aside
his lawful wife.

Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince Ragger,

598

and remarried him to someone else

and annulments and bowel movements

00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,321
TORMUND: Hmm.

639
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,739
I'll be staying behind.

640
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,117
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

641
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:31,906
You are.

642
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,871
You really want
to go out there? Again?

643
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,011
You're not the only ones.

644
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:53,053
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

645
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:55,104
Said they were on their way here.

646
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,275
You're the Hound.

647
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:07,025
I saw you once at Winterfell.

648
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,907
They want to go Beyond the Wall, too.

649
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,085
We don't want to go Beyond the Wall,
we have to.

650
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,371
Our lord told us that
a great war is coming...

651
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,002
GENDRY: Don't trust him.

652
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,550
Don't trust any of them.

653
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,803
They're the Brotherhood.

654
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,386
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

655
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,688
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

656
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:38,773
JORAH: Thoros?

657
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,442
Well, I hardly recognized you.

658
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,823
Ser Jorah Mormont.

659
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,701
They won't give me anything to drink
down here.

660
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,746
I haven't been feeling like myself.

661
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,869
TORMUND: You're a fucking Mormont?

662
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,580
Like the last Lord Commander?

663
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:03,874
- He was my father.
- He hunted us, like animals.

664
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,876
You returned the favor, as I recall.

665
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:12,591
Here we all are,
at the edge of the world,

666
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,468
at the same moment,

667
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:17,020
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

668
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,065
Our reasons aren't your reasons.

669
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,689
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

670
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,321
There's a greater purpose at work.

671
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,952
And we serve it together,
whether we know it or not.

672
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,955
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light clears the...

673
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:39,205
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

674
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,035
Are we coming with you or not?

675
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,542
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

676
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:48,593
Is it worse than sitting
in a freezing cell, waiting to die?

677
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,090
He's right.

678
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,510
We're all on the same side.

679
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,346
How can we be?

680
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,104
We're all breathing.

681
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,744
